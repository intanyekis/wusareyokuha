It’s a soul connection that can never be erased. … We hold no blame, anger or contempt for each other and we ask for privacy and positive wishes for us both as we learn how to navigate through this.”</p><p>According to their filing, which was obtained by Us Weekly, the pair asserted that they “still have love and respect for one another.” <a href=#>Musgraves cited “irreconcilable differences”</a> as the reason for the split.</p><p>Two months later, the singers’ divorce was made final. A source told Us at the time that while Musgraves “was the one who initiated” the separation, <a href=#>she was “really upset”</a> about the end of her marriage.</p><p>The “Butterflies” artist didn’t <a href=#>publicly address the breakup</a> until February 2021, telling Rolling Stone that there’s a small part of her that “questions marriage as a whole, in general.”</p><p>She added, “I mean, I was open to it when it came into my life. I embraced it. I just have to tell myself I was brave to follow through on those feelings.”</p><p>Several months after breaking her silence, Musgraves revealed that she felt a shift in her relationship during the coronavirus pandemic. While she was thriving in her career, <a href=#>things were different at home</a>, causing a number of questions to form in her mind.</p><p>“Why did I make these decisions? How did I get here?” she recalled wondering in the June/July 2021 issue of Elle. “How can I prevent myself from getting there again? Why do I keep choosing the same kind of people?”</p><p>Though marriage might not be for her, the seven-time CMA Award winner has let herself fall in love again. She was briefly linked to <a href=#>Nashville-based doctor <strong>Gerald Onuoua</strong></a> before going public with <a href=#>boyfriend <strong>Cole Schafer</strong></a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Life is so much prettier with you in it,” the “Space Cowboy” singer <a href=#>gushed in an Instagram comment</a> after the writer shared a handful of black-and-white PDA pics in August 2021.</p><p>Scroll down to see Musgraves’ most candid quotes about life and love after her divorce:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKKvxLJkpq2jnL%2BiwsSsZKqtn6mytHnAm6aurF2htqexjJqdrZ2iYr%2B2v9OopWajlaG5unnSqaOirF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
