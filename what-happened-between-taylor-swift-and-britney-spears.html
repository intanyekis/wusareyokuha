The cultural impact and talent of the two women are undeniable. However, what might surprise a lot of people is how far back their history dates.</p><p>Swift actually first met Spears backstage at one of Spears' concerts, before she was a star herself. However, Spears herself recently shared details of that first meeting, which surprised many. It was also confusing to some, as Spears once seemed to forget ever meeting Swift during an interview.</p><p>Swift has a lot of respect for Spears, having written a song which many believe is about the pop princess. This speculation was fueled when Swift released a music video for the song and seemed to reference one of Spears' looks.</p><h2 id=britney-posted-about-the-first-time-she-met-taylor-on-instagram>Britney Posted About The First Time She Met Taylor On Instagram</h2><p>2023 is no doubt Swift's year.

It was backstage at the singer's "Oops!...I Did It Again World Tour" in 2000.</p><p>"This is way back when but kinda cool," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spears wrote</a>. "During my Oops Tour, I got a knock at my door. My good friend at the time was the assistant to my manager who was trying to become a manager himself. There was a knock, and then he said, 'I have a girl named Taylor who wants to come in and sing for you.' I was like of course !!!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Spears, Swift proceeded to play a "beautiful song" on her guitar.</p><p>"I was like wow wow she’s unbelievable !!! We took a picture, and she then became the most iconic pop woman of our generation. Kinda cool she plays stadiums, and I prefer her videos over movies any day," she continued.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/your-paragraph-text-2023-11-23t163854-959.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="David Letterman Worried He Was Going To Offend Taylor Swift By Revealing What She Smelled Like During Their Interview ">David Letterman Worried He Was Going To Offend Taylor Swift By Revealing What She Smelled Like During Their Interview</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>David Letterman's reveal of what Taylor Swift smelled like wasn't what the artist and the fans were expecting.</p><p>Spears continued showering Swift with praise, calling her "stunning" and proclaiming Swift was her "girl crush."</p><p>Spears has praised Swift in the past, telling E!

She was asked to choose between Swift and Katy Perry. Spears' response sent the internet into meltdown mode.</p><p>"I don’t know! I don’t know, that’s hard. They’re both so cool, I don’t know," Spears said. "I’ve briefly met Katy Perry at the Smurfs movie premiere. Maybe because I’ve met Katy Perry, I would say Taylor Swift because I’ve never met her before."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/instar47150368.jpg><p>Spears was asked to choose between Swift and Perry due to their public feud during that time.

Swift added. "It had to do with business. She basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour. She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me. And I'm surprisingly non-confrontational—you would not believe how much I hate conflict. So, now I have to avoid her. It's awkward, and I don't like it."</p><p>Swift and Perry eventually buried the hatchet by reuniting in the "You Need To Calm Down" music video.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=many-believe-taylor-referenced-britney-in-one-of-the-songs-on-her-39-red-39-album>Many Believe Taylor Referenced Britney In One Of The Songs On Her 'Red' Album</h2><p>In 2000, Spears released her sophomore album "Oops!...I Did It Again." The album's second single, "Lucky," was another huge hit. The song talks about a fictional Hollywood star who, despite her fame and success, cries at night because she is so unhappy.</p><p>"And they say/She’s so lucky/She’s a star/But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking/If there's nothing missing in my life/Then why do these tears come at night," Spears sings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/instar51920009-1.jpg><p>As years went on and Spears' own personal troubles played out in the media, many attributed the song to be about the pop star herself. After Swift released her "Red" album in 2012, many believed she shared these thoughts thanks to one of the album's songs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The Lucky One" is a song about a star who moved away to find solitude after her secrets were leaked to the world.
