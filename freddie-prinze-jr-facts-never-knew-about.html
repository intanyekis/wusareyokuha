Freddie was lucky to have a loving wife to help him out of the addiction.</p><h2 id=his-wedding-was-almost-a-disaster>HIS WEDDING WAS ALMOST A DISASTER</h2><p>The Hollywood stars' wedding was almost compromised by a big natural disaster. The pair tied the knot in 2002 in Mexico the day after a hurricane. On the day before the wedding, Hurricane Hernan forced them to move their outdoor ceremony inside.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the event, an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">earthquake</a> hit the area while the guests were on their way home.

He occasionally has a glass of sake when he is out on date night with the love of his life, Gellar.</p><p>The two have made it a tradition to go for date nights and have sushi with Japanese rice wine every once in a while.

The book includes many of his recipes, with his mother’s signature tomato soup, and speaks a lot of his Puerto Rican heritage and Mexican upbringing.</p><h2 id=prinze-has-never-watched-buffy>PRINZE HAS NEVER WATCHED BUFFY</h2><p>Freddie's most jaw-dropping revelation was not having watched <a href=#>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>&nbsp;despite Buffy being his biggest fan. Considering Gellar starred on the show for seven years including the time they started dating, it comes as a very disappointing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confession</a>&nbsp;for fans.</p><p>He says, at his age, he was definitely not part of the show’s demographic. He was, however, on the set severally visiting his then-girlfriend, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gellar</a>. Later on, she had him get a taste of it by making him watch two episodes of the show one being the musical episode.</p><h2 id=he-is-a-martial-artist-with-a-black-belt>HE IS A MARTIAL ARTIST WITH A BLACK BELT</h2><p>Having been introduced into martial arts by his godfather at the age of three, he developed a liking for the art and holds a blue belt in Jiujitsu.

He was downcast and troubled for being the son of a Freddie Prinze, a comedian, and actor who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p><p>His mother moved with him to Albuquerque in search of a more peaceful life when he was four but instead, he became a subject of bullying for his queerness. His lack of a father figure left a deep void in his heart as no one talked to him about his father’s death until he was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">older</a>.</p><h2 id=he-was-involved-in-illegal-gambling>HE WAS INVOLVED IN ILLEGAL GAMBLING</h2><p>Before his first acting gig, Prinze was making it big in an illegal business.

While it was a great opportunity for him to star alongside his wife on the animated franchise, he initially turned down the role. During the filming, he had to die his hair blonde every week causing a lot of damage&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">forcing</a> him to shave bald afterward.</p><p>The movie turned out to be a success at the box office although Freddie revealed that he did not enjoy himself much in the filming.
