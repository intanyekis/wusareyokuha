It can be a pain to find the right bra for you. You’ve got to worry about your cup size, calculate the right band size, and most importantly, ensure every part of it contours to your body to give you the support you’re looking for. But sometimes, our bodies get in the way."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

You’ve got to worry about your cup size, calculate the right band size, and most importantly, ensure every part of it contours to your body to give you the support you’re looking for. But sometimes, our bodies get in the way. We’re all different, and one size doesn’t fit all. That’s why bras can often draw attention to some of our problem areas that we don’t want others to see.</p><p>Case in point: our backs and our sides. People have love handles, sure. But that doesn’t mean we want to put them on full display or wear them hanging out of a bra that doesn’t fit us very well, do we? That’s why, if your body has bigger hips or extra padding around your sides or back area, you need a bra that can work with you so you can look and feel like a million bucks.</p><p>Here’s the tea: You don’t have to make a trip to Victoria’s Secret to search for a great bra.
