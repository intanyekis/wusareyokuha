He was a comedian, actor, and host, best known for his role as Corporal Peter Newkirk in “Hogan’s Heroes”. Dawson was also the original host of “Family Feud”. His various endeavors contributed to his net worth prior to his passing in 2012.</p><p>Richard Dawson’s net worth in mid-2016 was reported to be $100,000, primarily from his extensive television career. He also had roles in several films and became a regular panelist on game shows, all of which contributed to his wealth. However, his net worth might have gradually decreased due to medical treatments.</p><h3>Richard Dawson Net Worth $100,000</h3><p>At the age of 14, Richard joined the British Merchant Navy and pursued a boxing career before being discharged two years later. He later ventured into a comedy career, initially using the stage name Dickie Dawson but later switched to Richard Dawson in adulthood.</p><p>His acting career began with appearances on “The Jack Benny Program” and “The Dick Van Dyke Show” in the same year. This was followed by appearances in “The Outer Limits” and “The Alfred Hitchcock Hour”, as well as roles in films such as “The Longest Day” and “King Rat”. His popularity and net worth started to significantly increase during his time on the television show “Hogan’s Heroes”.</p><p>Richard then transitioned to game shows, starting with “Match Game ’73”. He later appeared as a panelist on “I’ve Got a Secret” and “Match Game”. He eventually got the opportunity to host “Family Feud” in 1976, which became hugely successful, surpassing the ratings of his previous projects. His unique habit of kissing female contestants on the show, although initially met with criticism from television executives, became a trademark move and was positively received by the audience.</p><p>After “Family Feud”, Richard appeared in “The Running Man” as a parody of his game show host persona. He was also set to be part of a revival of “You Bet Your Life”, but the show was not picked up. He eventually returned for the final season of the “Family Feud” revival in 1995 before retiring and moving to Beverly Hills.</p><p>Richard married Gretchen Johnson, a former contestant on “Family Feud”, and they had a daughter. He had also been previously married to actress Diana Dors, with whom he had two children. Richard passed away in Los Angeles in June 2012 due to complications from esophageal cancer.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Trademarks</li><li>Quotes</li><li>Facts</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li><li>Awards</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Richard Dawson</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$100 Thousand</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>November 20, 1932</td></tr><tr><td>Died</td><td>June 2, 2012, Los Angeles, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Gosport, United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.75 m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American, British</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Gretchen Johnson (m. 1991–2012), Diana Dors (m. 1959–1966)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Mark Dawson, Gary Dawson, Shannon Dawson</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Josephine Emm, Arthur Emm</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0206241/</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>Cocaine Angel, The Running Man, Oliver and the Artful Dodger, The Devil’s Brigade, King Rat, Treasure Island</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Match Game, The New Dick Van Dyke Show, Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In, Hogan’s Heroes, I’ve Got a Secret, Masquerade Party (Original), Family Feud, Masquerade Party</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Related posts:</h3><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmipopuYlr%2BlecOarqynnmK7psCMsKarrJhk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
