William Rulla</strong> told the paper that the incident began at 6:30 a.m., when police got a call from a woman who had found the body of her male roommate (whose name has not been disclosed) dead inside their home. As police investigated the death, they discovered that another one of the caller's roommates, Debby Constantino, was missing.</p><p>Using a cellphone tracking device, police were able to find Debby inside her daughter's apartment with her estranged spouse, Mark, who had kidnapped her.</p><p>Reno Police Department Deputy Chief <strong>Tom Robinson</strong> told the Gazette Journal that once police arrived on the scene and knocked on the apartment's door, they heard the sound of several shots being fired. According to KTVN, shots were fired at the officers through the door.</p><p>The suspect then told police to "give me 15 minutes to gather my thoughts or I'll kill her," reported the Gazette Journal.</p><p>Police tried negotiating with the suspect, and were later joined by local FBI agents who tried to get Mark to surrender. After hours of futile negotiation, the SWAT team forced entry into the apartment, using explosives to blast the front door open. Inside, the Travel Channel stars were both found dead.</p><p>Police did not reveal the manner in which they were killed.</p><p>During the entire standoff, the local Sparks High School, located near the apartment, was placed on lockdown. The precaution was lifted at 2:35 p.m. local time.</p><p>This wasn't the couple's first domestic violence incident. Last month, Mark was charged with kidnapping and domestic battery against his estranged wife. She had obtained a restraining order against him. Their adult daughter — who owned the apartment in which the couple died — was also charged as an accomplice in that particular incident.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Watch footage from their Travel Channel show above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGagoJ%2BowW6tw6%2Bcp6ylp7K0ecKorKmklWKxpq3DZqeopJmYsm6wxK2YoqRdnby0wMCgnGarpJa7pbvFn2RraGFqf3WFjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
