The image was snapped in 1990 at the Pasadena aquatic center when the Los Angeles native was four-months-old. The famous album cover, which late lead singer Kurt Cobain picked out, shows a naked baby swimming underwater toward a dollar bill on a string.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Elden's legal team said in the suit that "to ensure the album cover would trigger a visceral sexual response from the viewer, (photographer Kirk) Weddle activated Spencer’s 'gag reflex' before throwing him underwater in poses highlighting and emphasizing Spencer’s exposed genitals."</p><p>The suit goes on to state: "as an essential element of a record promotion scheme commonly utilized in the music industry to get attention, wherein album covers posed children in a sexually provocative manner to gain notoriety, drive sales, and garner media attention, and critical reviews."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Elden, the 90's grunge band had promised that a sticker would be placed on the area of his genitals, but it never occurred. Elden is asking for $150,000 from each of 17 defendants named in the suit - much to the disgust of Nirvana fans.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Are Going Wild For Madonna's 'Nirvana Rendition' Of 'Smells Like Teen Spirit'</a></span></p><p>"Took him 30 years to figure this out ?
