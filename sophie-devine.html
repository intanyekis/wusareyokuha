In the New Zealander domestic circuit, Sophie has played for Wellington (2003-04-2006-07, 2008-09-Present) and Canterbury (2007-08) across all formats. She has also played domestic cricket outside of her home country, representing South Australia (2014-15-2015-16, 2017-18) and Western Australia (2018-19-2019-20) in Australia and Warwickshire (2017-2018) in England. In franchise-based T20 cricket, she has turned out for the Adelaide Strikers (2015-16-2019-20) and the Perth Scorchers (2020-21-Present) in the WBBL (Women’s Big Bash League); Loughborough Lightning (2016, 2018) and Yorkshire Diamonds (2017) in the WCSL (Women’s Cricket Super League); Supernovas (2018-2019) in the Women’s T20 Challenge; and the Royal Challengers Bangalore (2023)&nbsp;in the WPL (Women’s Premier League).

When she was about 14 years old, she made her first-class cricket debut and also started playing senior-level women’s field hockey. In the early days of her international cricketing career (the mid and late 2000s), she also represented New Zealand in field hockey.</li><li>In the ‘Super Six’ stage of the 2009 edition of the ICC&nbsp;(International Cricket Council) Women’s Cricket World Cup, she was New Zealand’s best bowler in the team’s first 2 of its 3 matches – 2/45 in 8 overs in a 31-run loss to England and 2/35 in 8.4 overs in a 5-wicket win over India.</li><li>The latter result played a vital role in helping New Zealand finish within the ‘Top 2’ positions in the ‘Super Six’ stage which meant that the team advanced to the final of the tournament. England defeated New Zealand by 4 wickets there to win the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup for the 3rd time. For her performances, Sophie was named the 12th player in the ‘Team of the Tournament’ announced by the ICC.</li><li>At both the first two (2009 and 2010) editions of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup, she was a part of the New Zealand squad that reached the final. In the final of the former tournament, Sophie was her team’s best bowler (1/12 in 3 overs) in a 6-wicket defeat to England. In the final of the latter tournament, she was the top scorer (38 runs not out) but could not prevent a heart-breaking defeat to Australia by 3 runs.</li><li>In New Zealand’s 2nd group stage match of the 2012&nbsp;ICC Women’s T20 World Cup, she produced a match-best score of 59 runs in a 22-run win over South Africa. She was named the ‘Player of the Match’ for her performance and the win eventually proved decisive in New Zealand’s qualification for the semi-final stage of the tournament.</li><li>In New Zealand’s opening group-stage match of the 2013 edition of the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup, against South Africa, Sophie scored 145 runs to steer her team to a mammoth total of 321 runs. New Zealand won the match by a humongous margin of 150 runs and she was named the ‘Player of the Match’ for recording the first WODI (and international) century of her career.</li><li>As of February 2023, this knock of 145 runs was still the 3rd-highest score by a player batting at the number 4 position in a WODI match. New Zealand eventually progressed to the ‘Super Six’ stage of the tournament where they finished in the 4th position. The team then lost the 3rd place playoff to England by 4 wickets and finished 4th overall.</li><li>In New Zealand’s 4th (and last) group-stage match of the 2014 edition of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup, against South Africa, Sophie produced an excellent all-round effort (40 runs and 2/26 in 4 overs) but could not prevent a 5-wicket defeat. The defeat was a rather bitter one for New Zealand because the team crashed out of the tournament despite winning its first 3 group-stage matches.</li><li>Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand had all finished on 6 points at the end of the group stage of this tournament but Australia and South Africa qualified for the semi-final stage due to a superior net run rate (derived by calculating the average runs per over scored by a team throughout the competition and subtracting, from it, the average runs per over scored against that team throughout the competition). This was the 4th edition of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup and the first time that New Zealand would not be a part of its semi-final stage.</li><li>In July 2015, in a match against India, Sophie broke the record for the fastest half-century in a WT20I match – she reached that milestone in just 18 balls.</li><li>With 9 wickets to her name in 5 matches, Sophie (the vice-captain of the New Zealand squad) was the joint-highest wicket-taker in the 2016 edition of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup. She produced match-best bowling figures (3/16 in 3 overs) in New Zealand’s last group-stage match against South Africa, resulting in a 7-wicket win and a ‘Player of the Match’ award. She produced match-best bowling figures (4/22 in 4 overs) in the semi-final as well but could not prevent a narrow 6-run defeat to the eventual (and 1st time) champions West Indies. She was included in the ICC‘s ‘Team of the Tournament’.</li><li>In New Zealand’s 5th game of the league phase of the 2017 edition of the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup, against Pakistan, Sophie smashed 93 runs in just 41 balls to help her team chase down a target of 145 runs in just 15 overs, with 8 wickets to spare. During that knock, she hit 9 sixes, the then-most by a player in a WODI match. New Zealand eventually finished the league stage in the 5th position and narrowly missed out on a semi-final berth.</li><li>In New Zealand’s 4th (and last) group-stage match of the 2018 edition of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup, against Ireland, she scored 51 runs off just 22 balls in an 8-wicket win. She won the ‘Player of the Match’ award for her blistering knock – her fifty (achieved in 21 balls) was the then joint-fastest in the tournament’s history. The win was a bit too late though, as the team had already been eliminated from the tournament.</li><li>Representing the Adelaide Strikers, Sophie finished the 2018-19 season (4th) of the WBBL (Women’s Big Bash League) as the 2nd highest run-scorer overall – with 556 runs to her name in just 13 innings. She also finished in 2nd place in the voting for the ‘Player of the Tournament’ that season – votes were awarded on a 3-2-1 basis by the two standing umpires after every match. Besides, she was included in the ‘Team of the Tournament’ for the 3rd successive season.</li><li>In the next (2019-20) season of the WBBL, she was the highest run-getter (769 runs in 16 innings) overall and the joint 4th highest wicket-taker (19 wickets in 16 innings). Through her all-around heroics, she won the ‘Player of the Match’ award 6 times during the season. Sophie was also named the ‘Player of the Series’ and was included in the ‘Team of the Tournament’ for the 4th successive season.</li><li>In the semi-final of this season, against her future team Perth Scorchers, she recorded a ‘Player of the Match’ winning knock of 65 runs not out to steer the Adelaide Strikers to an 8-wicket win. The Adelaide Strikers&nbsp;lost the final (their first such appearance) to the Brisbane Heat (their 2nd title in a row) by 6 wickets. During the season, Sophie also set a new WBBL record for the most sixes scored off consecutive deliveries (5).</li><li>At the 2020 edition of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup, she captained the New Zealand squad. In the team’s opening group stage match, against Sri Lanka, she scored 75 runs not out in a 7-wicket win. Her knock made her the first cricketer in history, male or female, to have recorded 6 consecutive innings of 50 or more runs in the T20I format.</li><li>Although New Zealand defeated Bangladesh in its 3rd group-stage match of this tournament, the win was sandwiched by heart-breaking narrow defeats to India (3 runs) and Australia (4 runs) which meant that New Zealand crashed out of the group stage of the tournament for the 2nd successive edition.</li><li>In July 2020, she was appointed the captain of the New Zealand senior national women’s cricket team full-time, taking over from <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Amy Satterthwaite</a>.</li><li>In the 2020-21 season (6th) of the WBBL, her first with the Perth Scorchers, Sophie won the ‘Player of the Series’ award for the 2nd time in succession. She also captained the team for the majority of the season, finished as the 3rd highest run-scorer overall (460 runs in 12 innings), and was included in the ‘Team of the Tournament’ for the 5th successive season. During the season, she also became the first player to hit 100 career sixes in the WBBL.</li><li>In January 2021, she broke the women’s T20 record for the fastest century – she reached the milestone in 36 balls in a match that was a part of the 2020-21 season of the Super Smash (the premier domestic T20 cricket competition in New Zealand).</li><li>In November 2021, her second season with the Perth Scorchers, Sophie won her 1st WBBL title. In the final of the tournament, she top-scored (35 runs) for the Perth Scorchers in a 12-run win over her previous team, the Adelaide Strikers. She finished the 2021-22 WBBL season as the 3rd highest run-scorer overall for the 2nd time in a row – this time with 442 runs in 14 innings. She also finished in 2nd place in the voting for the ‘Player of the Tournament’ and was included in the ‘Team of the Tournament’ for the 6th successive season.</li><li>She captained the New Zealand squad a the 2022 edition of the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup. In the opening match of the league phase of the tournament, against the West Indies, she scored the 6th WODI century of her career. However, her knock of 108 runs was insufficient to prevent a narrow 3-run defeat. In her team’s 5th match in the league stage, against South Africa, Sophie produced a match-best score of 93 runs but South Africa managed to eke out a 2-wicket win with just 3 balls to spare. These 2 results scuppered New Zealand’s campaign – the hosts finished the league stage in the 6th position and narrowly missed out (by a solitary point) on a semi-final berth.</li><li>Sophie captained the New Zealand squad at the 2022 Birmingham Commonwealth Games. It was the first occasion where women’s cricket was included in the Commonwealth Games and just the 2nd time that cricket was played at the Commonwealth Games – a men’s tournament had previously been featured at the 1998 edition held in Kuala Lumpur. In New Zealand’s opening group-stage match of the tournament, against South Africa, she produced match-best bowling figures (3/37 in 4 overs) to guide New Zealand to a 13-run victory.</li><li>During that match, she recorded her 100th wicket in the WT20I format. The win eventually proved decisive in New Zealand’s qualification for the semi-final stage of the tournament. In the semi-final, she produced a match-best knock of 53 runs but could not prevent eventual champions Australia from winning by 5 wickets in the last over of the match. Despite the defeat, Sophie was named the ‘Player of the Match’.</li><li>In the ‘Bronze’ medal match, against hosts England, she again produced a match-best knock of 51 runs not out, guiding New Zealand to an 8-wicket win with a massive 8.1 overs to spare. She won the ‘Player of the Match’ award again and finished as the 2nd-highest run-getter in the tournament, with 177 runs to her name in 5 innings – just 2 runs behind <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Beth Mooney</a> of Australia (179 runs in 5 innings).</li><li>In February 2023, in the auction for the upcoming inaugural edition of the WPL (Women’s Premier League), Sophie was acquired by the Royal Challengers Bangalore&nbsp;(RCB) for INR 50 lakhs.</li><li>She suffers from Type 1 diabetes, a disorder that originates when cells that make insulin are destroyed by the sufferer’s immune system.</li><li>While playing for RCB, Sophie Devine smashed the biggest six (94 meters-six) of the Women’s Premier League&nbsp;(WPL) in March 2023. It was the 9th over and Tanuja Kanwar was bowling. Overall, she scored 99 runs from 36 balls in that match.</li><li>She won ₹5 lakhs (or NZD 9,810) for being the ‘Power Striker of the Season’ in the WPL 2023 tournament. She hit 13 sixes overall.</li><p>Featured Image by Sophie Devine / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqymqaCZmnqlsdWipZ5n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
