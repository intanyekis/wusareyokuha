He was a key member of the Indian squad that won the 2007 (inaugural) edition of the ICC (International Cricket Council) World Twenty20. In the Indian domestic circuit, Robin mostly played for his home state of Karnataka (2002-03-2016-17) across all 3 formats. With Karnataka, he won the prestigious Ranji Trophy (the premier domestic first-class cricket competition in India) in both the 2013-14 and the 2014-15 seasons. The latter title was Karnataka’s 8th such and made it the then 2nd most successful team in the history of the competition. With Karnataka, he also won the Vijay Hazare Trophy (the premier domestic one-day cricket competition in India) in both the 2013-14 and the 2014-15 seasons. These were Karnataka’s first 2 such titles and made it only the 3rd team at that time – after Tamil Nadu and Mumbai – to have won this title more than once. At the fag end of his domestic career, Robin also represented Saurashtra (2017-2018) and Kerala (2019-2022). In the IPL (Indian Premier League), he turned out for the Mumbai Indians (2008), the Royal Challengers Bangalore (2009-2010), the Pune Warriors India (2011-2013), the Kolkata Knight Riders (2014-2019), the Rajasthan Royals (2020), and the Chennai Super Kings (2021-2022). With the Kolkata Knight Riders, he won the IPL title in 2014. With the Chennai Super Kings, he won the IPL title in 2021. In September 2022, Robin announced his retirement from all forms of cricket. Post-retirement, he has worked as a cricket analyst and commentator with several different TV networks and online cricket websites.</p><h3>Born Name</h3><p>Robin Venu Uthappa</p><h3>Nick Name</h3><p>Robbie, The Walking Assassin</p><figure id=attachment_467794 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-467794 style=width:500px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Robin Uthappa as seen in an Instagram Post in April 2023 (Robin Uthappa / Instagram)</figure><h3>Sun Sign</h3><p>Scorpio</p><h3>Born Place</h3><p>Kodagu, Karnataka, India</p><h3>Residence</h3><p>Karnataka, India</p><h3>Nationality</h3><p></p><h3>Education</h3><p>Robin had attended the <strong>Sri Bhagawan Mahaveer Jain College (SBMJC)</strong>, a prominent college that has 5 campuses spread over Bengaluru (the capital and largest city of the southern Indian state of Karnataka) and a campus in Kolar Gold Fields (a mining region in the Kolar district of Karnataka).</p><h3>Occupation</h3><p>Professional Cricketer (Retired)</p><figure id=attachment_467795 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-467795 style=width:500px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Robin Uthappa as seen in an Instagram Post in May 2019 (Robin Uthappa / Instagram)</figure><h3>Family</h3><ul><li><strong>Father</strong> – Venu Uthappa (Former Field Hockey Umpire)</li><li><strong>Mother </strong>– Roselyn ‘Rosie’ Uthappa</li><li><strong>Siblings&nbsp;</strong>– Sharon Uthappa (Older Sister) (Mental Health Therapist/Counselor, Social Worker)</li><li><strong>Others</strong> – Arjun Goutham (Brother-in-Law) (Former Tennis Player)</li></ul><h3>Manager</h3><p>He has been represented by Rohan Rao, Marketing & Booking Agent, NuStart, Sports Marketing, Athlete Management, & IP Development Firm, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.</p><h3>Batting</h3><p>Right-Handed</p><h3>Bowling</h3><p>Right-Arm Medium</p><h3>Role</h3><p>Top-Order Batter, Occasional Wicketkeeper</p><h3>Jersey Number</h3><ul><li>17, 77, 37 – One Day International (ODI)</li><li>77 – T20 International (T20I), Chennai Super Kings (IPL)</li><li>17 – Pune Warriors India (IPL)</li><li>37 – Kolkata Knight Riders (IPL), Dubai Capitals (ILT20)</li><li>07 – Rajasthan Royals (IPL)</li></ul><h3>Build</h3><p>Athletic</p><h3>Height</h3><p>5 ft 7 in or 170 cm</p><h3>Weight</h3><p>72 kg or 158.5 lbs</p><h3>Girlfriend / Spouse</h3><p>Robin has dated –</p><li><strong>Sheethal Goutham</strong> (2016-Present) – Robin married an Indian former professional tennis player and his long-time girlfriend, Sheethal Goutham, in March 2016.

It was the 2nd edition of the tournament and the 2nd successive title for India.</li><li>He was then included in the Indian squad for the 2004 edition (5th) of the ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup. Robin was India’s 2nd-highest run-getter in the team’s 1st and 3rd group stage matches – scoring 97 runs against Scotland and 59 runs against Bangladesh, respectively. <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Shikhar Dhawan</a>, a fellow future international player for India, was the top-scorer in both those matches.</li><li>India won all 3 of its matches in the group stage quite comfortably to progress to the ‘Super League’ stage of the competition. Although Robin’s bat was quiet in that phase of the tournament, India won 2 out of its 3 matches to progress to the semi-final stage. He top-scored for India (33 runs) in the semi-final but the team folded for just 169 runs – a dismal total that was overhauled quite easily by arch-rivals Pakistan (who went on to win the final and their 1st ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup title).</li><li>Robin finished the tournament as India’s 3rd highest run-getter (13th overall) in the tournament with 237 runs to his name in 7 innings – only behind <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Suresh Raina</a> (another fellow future international player for India) who scored 247 runs in 7 innings (10th highest run-getter overall) and Shikhar Dhawan who scored 505 runs in 7 innings (highest run-getter overall). Shikhar was also named the ‘Player of the Series’. His tally of 505 runs was the then record for the most runs scored in a single edition of the ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup. The record was broken at the 2022 edition of the tournament by <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Dewald Brevis</a> of South Africa who scored 506 runs in just 6 innings. Dewald, just like Shikhar, was named the ‘Player of the Series’.</li><li>Robin made his ODI (and international) debut for India in April 2006 in the 7th (and final) match of a home bilateral ODI series against England. He impressed everyone with his fluent strokeplay and scored 86 runs as an opening batter before being dismissed via a run-out.</li><li>It was the then-highest score by an Indian debutant in a limited-overs (ODI or T20I) match. His knock helped India chase down their target of 289 runs with ease and win the series by a 5-1 margin. India’s victory in this match extended its world record of successive ODI wins while chasing (batting second) 16 matches.</li><li>Robin made his T20I debut for India in September 2007, against Scotland – in India’s opening group stage match of the 2007 ICC World Twenty20. However, the match had to be abandoned (with a toss) due to incessant rain.</li><li>In the very next match (the last of the group stage), against arch-rivals Pakistan, he top-scored with 50 runs in India’s below-par total of 141 runs. This was the first 50 scored by an Indian player in a T20I match. India’s bowlers, however, managed to restrict Pakistan to a score of 141/7 in 20 overs in a manic finish. The winner was then decided via a bowl-out which India won by a 3-0 margin and qualified for the ‘Super 8s’ stage of the competition. Robin was one of the 3 Indian players who participated and succeeded in the bowl-out.</li><li>This was just the 2nd tied T20I match in history and the 2nd occasion that a bowl-out (5 bowlers from each side deliver 1/2 balls each at an unguarded wicket (3 stumps)) was used as a tiebreaker in a T20I match. In October 2008, a match between Canada and Zimbabwe was the 3rd tied T20I in history as well as the final international match to have been decided by a bowl-out. Thereafter, it was replaced by the ‘Super Over’ (both teams play a single over of 6 balls, with 2 wickets in hand) as a tiebreaker for limited-overs matches. This meant that the aforementioned match between India and Pakistan would remain, forever, the only match in the ICC World Twenty20 (or any other major ICC tournament) to have been decided via a bowl-out.</li><li>Robin was the second most expensive player (bought by the Pune Warriors India for USD 2.1 million) at the auction where players were being acquired for the 2011 season of the IPL – only behind <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Gautam Gambhir</a> who was acquired for USD 2.4 million by the Kolkata Knight Riders.</li><li>He had finished as the highest run-getter overall in the 2013-14 season of the Vijay Hazare Trophy with 536 runs to his name in just 8 innings. His performances were vital in helping Karnataka win India’s premier domestic one-day cricket competition for the first time ever.</li><li>Robin, representing the Kolkata Knight Riders, was the highest run-getter in the 2014 edition of the IPL – with 660 runs to his name in 16 innings. This was the 7th edition of the IPL and he had become just the 2nd Indian batter to have won the ‘Orange Cap’ (presented to the leading run-getter in an IPL season) – after the legendary <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Sachin Tendulkar</a> who had achieved the feat in 2010.</li><li>In 10 successive matches (the Kolkata Knight Riders‘ last 9 matches of the league stage as well as the ‘Qualifier 1’ match (the 1st match of the IPL‘s playoff stage that is contested between the teams that finished in the top 2 positions in the league stage – with the winner progressing to the final)) of the 2014 IPL season, Robin scored 40 or more runs – a record in the T20 format at that time.</li><li>His exploits with the bat helped the Kolkata Knight Riders win the IPL title for the 2nd time – their first title came in the 2012 season. The team had become just the 2nd in the IPL to have won more than 1 title – the first to do so was the Chennai Super Kings (who had won their first 2 IPL titles in 2010 and 2011).</li><li>The Kolkata Knight Riders&nbsp;won all their last 9 matches in the 2014 IPL season (their last 7 matches in the league stage, the ‘Qualifier 1’ match, and the final) – setting a new record for the most consecutive wins in a single IPL season. The record was still intact, as of July 2023. The team extended this streak to 10 matches by winning its opening game of the next (2015) IPL season. This record for the most consecutive wins by a team in the IPL was also still intact, as of July 2023. Robin had participated in all 10 of these matches.</li><li>He had finished as the highest run-getter overall in the 2014-15 season of the Ranji Trophy with 912 runs to his name in just 19 innings. His performances played a big hand in helping Karnataka win India’s premier domestic first-class cricket competition for the 8th time and consequently becoming the then 2nd most successful team in the competition’s history.</li><li>In April 2022, Robin and <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Shivam Dube</a> put together a partnership of 165 runs for the 3rd wicket for the Chennai Super Kings in an IPL match against the Royal Challengers Bangalore. As of July 2023, this remained the record for the highest 3rd wicket partnership in an IPL match.&nbsp;As of July 2023, he was also the 9th highest run-getter in the history of the IPL – with 4,952 runs to his name in 197 innings.</li><li>After announcing his retirement from all forms of cricket in September 2022, Robin turned out for the Dubai Capitals in the inaugural season (held in January and February 2023) of the ILT20 (International League T20), the top-level professional 20-over cricket league in the United Arab Emirates. The BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India, the governing body for the sport in the country) does not allow Indian players to participate in overseas T20 leagues if they are a part of the senior national team or even playing any level of domestic cricket. This has prompted certain Indian players who are nearing the end of their shelf life as professional cricketers to announce their retirement from all forms of major cricket (international, Indian domestic, and the IPL) and then play in certain cash-rich and newly established foreign T20 franchise-based leagues for a year or two.</li><li>His nickname, ‘The Walking Assassin’, was given in reference to an unusual batting tactic of his. Sometimes, while facing pace/fast bowlers, he would charge down the pitch to hit a lofted shot (instead of the usual tactic of playing from the batting crease – the method of stepping down the pitch is usually deployed against spin/slow bowlers).</li><p>Featured Image by Robin Uthappa / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqumm6GeYsK1tMCpp5pn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
