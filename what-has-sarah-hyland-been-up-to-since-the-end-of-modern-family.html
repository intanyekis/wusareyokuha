It was a lot of fun to be able to go into her ticks and see why she's wired the way that she is. I know a lot of people like that, so it was really fun to be able to talk about their experiences with their parents and really create this character."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hyland&nbsp;said that she loved shooting one scene at a wedding with a lot of dancing in it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Say This Is The Best Character From ‘Modern Family’</a></span></p><h2 id=wedding-planning>Wedding Planning</h2><p>There's one big thing that has happened in Sarah Hyland's personal life: in the summer of 2019, she and Wells Adams got engaged.</p><p>Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, they decided to move their wedding to a later date.
