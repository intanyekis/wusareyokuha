According to McElhenney, the King must be a supporter of the team. He said, "This is an incoming call. So we hope that he's a fan. If not, we'll make him a fan." Reynolds said he hoped to talk to the monarch about the work they were doing to improve the club and stadium. "I would love to tell him a little bit about what it is that we're hoping to achieve with the renovation of the Kop stand, and it's not even a renovation, I would say that it's a complete reimagining of the Kop stand, and what that will mean to not just the club, but the community of Wrexham as well," he reportedly said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoqp%2BXeq6vjJ6joZ2eo7K6ecKrmJyjo2K3sLfEZqeroZ6Ysm60wKupsmWdmrSprc1mpJqqm6GybrrErZ2loahisbCv1Kycq6GVqHqstc2gZJygkae5pr%2BMr6CsoaRixLOx16GYpg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
