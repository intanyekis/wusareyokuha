A mother of twins fell victim to lopsided breasts after nursing her infants — and the drastic difference was more noticeable than she would like.
To correct the asymmetry, TikToker Bobbi Althoff jokingly stuffed her shirt with an avocado in a clip that amassed1.8 million views on the app.
“Hope this hack helps you. Always bring some garlic salt just in case,” she captioned the video, which was posted last week."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Always bring some garlic salt just in case,” she captioned the video, which was posted last week.</p><p>The clip begins with Althoff standing in a tight, brown tank top, where her unevenness was evident.</p><p>“I refuse to let my inconsistency hold me back from wearing tight tank tops,” she begins the video. “So today, what I’m going to be doing is taking an avocado and sticking it inside to make them look even.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Calling it a “hack,” albeit as a joke, Althoff said she won’t let her uneven chest hold her back from wearing whatever she wants. <span class=credit>bobbialthoff/Tiktok</span></figure><p>Taking the avocado, she stuffs it up her shirt. As a result, her chest does, in fact, look more balanced — albeit lumpy.</p><p>“I just hope that when I’m walking, the avocado doesn’t fall out,” she said. “Because then I’d have to make guac and that would be embarrassing.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>Althoff, who regularly cracks jokes about motherhood and her kids online, is no stranger to making fun of herself on the internet — and neither are her followers. While her fans know not to take her seriously, users couldn’t help but play into the joke.</p><p>“Okay but can we substitute zucchini if it’s all we have,” one user quipped, to which Althoff said no, but “olives work.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Stuffing the avocado up her tight shirt, she showed how symmetrical — and lumpy — her fruit-enhanced chest looked after. <span class=credit>bobbialthoff/Tiktok</span></figure><p>“Tell me why I thought you were serious at first,” another joked.</p><p>“17 weeks pregnant and not ready for this,” wrote a soon-to-be mama, to which Althoff advised: “Switch sides when you nurse. I never do so this is the result.”</p><p>But uneven breasts — especially while breastfeeding — aren’t as uncommon as it seems. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Very Well Family</a>, “If one breast gets more stimulation (from a baby nursing or from a breast pump), it will produce more milk and grow larger than the other one. Uneven breasts can happen when a baby prefers one breast over the other or if you start nursing on the same breast most of the time.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-resized">While her followers know not to take her seriously, commenters couldn’t help but play into the joke. <span class=credit>bobbialthoff/Tiktok</span></figure><p>While experts suggest switching breasts, Althoff thinks it’s “too much effort.</p><p>“These guys look wild but they feed my baby so I’m okay with them.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3N7j3FmaWtfnnqprdWeZKWnoKi2pbHDZpmop5Koeqe%2BzqZkm6qVlsC1ssSem6Kml2LAsHnIZqqtrZaberi106Fkmq6fmK6lu44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
