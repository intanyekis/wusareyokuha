I’m embarrassed that I thought so highly of him.”</p><p>Bret Hart’s relationship with McMahon was fractured after the infamous Montreal Screwjob. They made amends when Hart returned to WWE ahead of WrestleMania 26. However, Hart now says he doesn’t think he could bring himself to shake McMahon’s hand.</p><p>“I think, despite all of the issues I ever had with Vince, I know, deep down, I always respected him; but now, knowing what kind of a weirdo he became, I have absolutely zero respect for him,” Hart wrote to me in a text message after our conversation. “I do not think I could ever shake his hand if he extended it. Too creepy.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNtamxuZ2Kvs7HTZp%2BaqqRivK951aKlnJ1dorCurceopWahnWKyrq7Aq6maq6OasW7Ax5qrZqFdqbWwwcahq2arn2K1qrPHpbBmp5Zitaq5</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
