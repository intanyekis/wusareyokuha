She was part of a major storyline that became very controversial and fans are still talking about it, amazed at what went down. A fan is speaking out on Reddit about a theory that they have come up with. Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=the-theory>The Theory</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Many parts of Below Deck are for real</a>&nbsp;but there is one storyline that people aren't so sure about.</p><p>A fan posted on Reddit that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hannah's storyline was made up</a>. They wrote, "Watching the reunion made me more confident in my theory that the whole Hannah drama was staged by production."</p><p>The fan continued that Hannah explained that she didn't want to work in the industry anymore and that she "didn't regret the season" as she made some good money. The fan thinks that Hannah wasn't interested in appearing on the show anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This fan explained more about their theory: "production offered a big contract with the stipulation of the Valium storyline allowing her an early out. Malia said at the reunion she saw the Valium the night of Hannah’s panic attack but didn’t report until later (production wasn’t ready for it yet). She also said she went to production before Sandy which seems shady."</p><p>Many people responded saying that this theory makes sense. One said that there are tons of storylines in the reality TV genre that are "staged" so they would understand if this one was, too.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Below Deck Franchise Just Keeps Getting Darker</a></span></p><h2 id=the-below-deck-storyline>The 'Below Deck' Storyline</h2><p>Let's take a closer look at the storyline on&nbsp;Below Deck&nbsp;that people are referring to.</p><p>According to&nbsp;People,&nbsp;Malia White told Capitan Sandy Yawn that Hannah had a CBD pen and&nbsp;Valium in her cabin on the boat. Later, Malia explained on&nbsp;Watch What Happens Live&nbsp;that Hannah had Valium because of anxiety.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Malia said, "I think in that moment when she asked for Valium is when it really hit me that those were the pills that she was taking every night all season. That’s when it became a real serious thing for me.” She continued, "I already had my bunk at that point, so, yeah, it was because it was my duty to. I don’t want to lose my licensing."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hannah-Ferrier.jpg><p>In August 2020, Hannah spoke to&nbsp;Decider.com&nbsp;and shared how difficult the whole thing was for her. She said that she wasn't trying to flush Valium down the&nbsp;toilet like it seemed on the show. She explained, "But it wouldn’t have crossed my mind to flush Valium, because I don’t think I’m doing anything wrong. It’s anti-anxiety medication. It’s like, it’s five milligrams of Valium! It was just disappointing."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hannah feels that she was made to look bad on the show because she has anxiety and she doesn't think that is fair for others who struggle with the same thing. She told&nbsp;Decider, "It’s anti-anxiety medication. I think I’ve just been really disappointed because I feel I’m being painted as some sort of drug addict or what have you. Which is just so sad, because there are so many people in the world that suffer from mental illness. And it’s 2020. We shouldn’t be making people feel like a lesser for taking medication for mental illness. Or making them feel like they can’t do a job, or they can’t do what normal people can do."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Craziest Moments Of Below Deck Mediterranean Season 4, Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=hannah-s-happy-life>Hannah's Happy Life</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hannah-Ferrier-pregnant.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A fan responded in the Reddit thread and shared that because Hannah is expecting a baby and seems super happy now, that could explain this storyline. They wrote, "I wouldn’t be surprised, Hannah was over yachting and now she’s happily pregnant and partnered up, it was probably an easy out. "</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hannah shared that she was pregnant in June 2020</a>&nbsp;and posted a photo of her belly on Instagram and wrote, "You are already my favourite adventure" in the caption. She said that she was five months along and that Josh, her boyfriend, is "over the moon."</p><p>According to&nbsp;Bravotv.com, Hannah and Josh had been together for two years in October 2020. She said on that special date, "2 year anniversary with my gorgeous man. Words can’t express how much I am looking forward to this next chapter."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Captain Sandy Might Fire Chef Kiko On ‘Below Deck Mediterranean’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No matter what the truth is about Hannah Ferrier's&nbsp;Below Deck&nbsp;storyline, whether it was made up because she wanted to leave the show or it was the real deal, one thing is for sure: Hannah is moving on from reality TV. On October 26, 2020, Hannah gave birth to her baby girl, Ava Grace. As she shared on Instagram, "Madam has arrived! Josh and I are so happy to welcome to the world our little girl - Ava Grace Roberts. Born on the 26th of October.
