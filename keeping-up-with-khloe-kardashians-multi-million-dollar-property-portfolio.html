Fourteen years later, the family has broken the internet and taken over the world with their lifestyle and trends. One of the most popular family members is Khloé Kardashian, best known as a popular media personality and businesswoman. The star has <a href=#>several business ventures</a> under her name, including Good American, a denim label, Dash, a boutique co-owned by the Kardashian sisters, a skincare line, and a Khloé Kardashian app. She has amassed a $50 million fortune through her businesses and is an Executive Producer on her family show that garners millions of viewers per episode.</p><p>Khloé Kardashian loves to spend her money buying luxury properties in different parts of America. Her collection of properties has always been a trending topic in the media. Let’s take a look inside Khloé Kardashian’s property portfolio.</p><h1>Tarzana Home</h1><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The first on the list is the Tarzana Home that Khloé Kardashian bought with her then-husband, Lamar Odom, in 2009. According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LA Times</a>, the couple purchased the house for $3.95 million. The Mediterranean-style villa located in the Tarzana neighborhood in Los Angeles has 0.75 acres of area with seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms. The two-story home also has a sweeping staircase, a den, home theatre, mosaic tile details, and custom closets.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 100 Million Real Estate Club: 6 Celebrity Mansions That Cost More Than $100 Million</a></span></p><p>The home looks like a resort and completes its look with an outdoor kitchen, firepit, spa, and swimming pools with waterfalls. In March 2014, the house was sold to Kaley Cuoco and her then-husband Ryan Sweeting for $5.499 million.</p><h2 id=calabasas-mansion>Calabasas Mansion</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Located in The Oaks, Calabasas is a preferred neighborhood by celebrities for the privacy it offers to the residence. The property was once <a href=#>owned by Eddie Murphy</a> and his wife and later by Justin Bieber before he sold it to Khloé Kardashian in March 2014. The home has a Moroccan-style exterior with a fountain that punctuates the ground. Its 11,000 sq. ft. of space features six bedrooms and seven bathrooms. There is an adjoining guesthouse next to the primary residence for guests.</p><p>The living room features a tented design from sheer fabric made by Martyn Lawrence Bullard, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Digest</a>. The white chic interior and myriad of windows make it a wide and open space. The home has outdoor lounging spaces, a custom large closet, a Glam Room, a screening room, and a pool. Kourtney had listed her house for $18.95 million in May 2020. However, she slashed down $3.5 million and sold it to YouTuber Dhar Mann for $15.5 million in November 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cleveland-estate>Cleveland Estate</h2><p>Khloé Kardashian’s Cleveland chapter ended after her boyfriend Tristan Thompson signed a contract to play for the Boston Celtic rather than Cleveland Cavaliers. First bought in 2015, the lakeside home has six bedrooms and seven bathrooms. Located on the shores of Lake Erie, the house had several amenities to keep the couple occupied. The property had a billiards room, a poker table, a theatre, a gym, a wine cellar, and a full bar, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>.</p><p>Purchased for $1.9 million, the couple listed the home in December 2020 for $3.25 million. The property was sold in April 2021 for $2.5 million. <a href=#>Khloé Kardashian posted a video of the home on Instagram</a> as she packed up her Ohio chapter. She reminisced about her time in Ohio and the amazing views offered by the house.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hidden-hills-mansion>Hidden Hills Mansion</h2><p>The Kardashian-Jenners are known to own several properties in the Hidden Hills neighborhood. Another addition to the portfolio occurred in 2019 when Khloé Kardashian and her mother Kris Jenner purchased side-by-side homes in the gated community. While Jenner purchased her home for $20 million, Khloé bought hers for $17 million. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Khloé’s place is smaller than her mother’s, covering 10,000 sq. ft. of land, while her mother has a 16,000 sq. ft. of property.</p><p>In November 2021, Kris Jenner moved into her home. However, Khloé’s is still under construction. The reality star has described the home as her dream place and plans to make it her permanent residence. While the amenities are not clear yet, the home has an oversized swimming pool designed with a modern-farmhouse architectural style. Located on the Hidden Hills' most exclusive part, her neighbors include French Montana, Howie Mandel, and Jeffree Star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From the first Tarzana Home purchased to the newest Hidden Hills property, Khloé Kardashian has a stunning property portfolio that costs millions of dollars. The Kardashian sister loves to use Mediterranean and Moroccan architecture in her homes to make them more beautiful. The star is all set to move into her new Hidden Hills home once the construction is finally completed.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Inside Barack & Michelle Obama's $12 Million Vineyard Mansion</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LA Times</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Digest</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4prHPoqWgZaWleri106FkpKCcpLJut8Crm5qrmJ6ur7%2BMpqylrJliuqq4y6Kmp2WUpLmtrdFmp6unoJq%2FtcWMqaarrJakuaq7jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
