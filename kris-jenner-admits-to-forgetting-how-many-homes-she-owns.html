I have a condo, and my mom has one, and my cousin has one, and we all live nearby," Kris admitted. "I kinda forgot it was there. That sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?"</p><p>It appeared the businesswoman hadn’t been to the condo in months, as evidence by the contents of the fridge. There were various bottles of Champagne, water, and a bottle of vinegar.</p><p>"I've never seen so much Champagne. Why is this all here?" Khloe asked her mom, to which Kris replied, “In case of an emergency.”</p><p>Kris and Khloe also found an array of things in the freezer, including frozen dinners, vegetables, and several bags saying “do not eat. The mother-and-daughter duo went on to clean the contents of the fridge and freezer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Later in the episode, Kris revealed the bizarre reason she keeps the condo – to use it as a gift wrapping station over the holidays. The momager fondly referred to the condo as “Santa’s Workshop. Kris added she hadn’t been to the condo since the previous December (the episode was filmed last year), implying she tends to forget about it when the holidays cease.</p><p>With a reported <a href=#>net worth of $230 millio</a>n, it’s no surprise that Kris Jenner has multiple properties to her name, though forgetting about how many you own is grossly unrelatable. And apparently, Kris is adding to her real estate portfolio.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In April, it was reported that Kris is close to being finished construction on <a href=#>side-by-side mansions with Khloe</a> in Hidden Hills after beginning the project in 2021. The mother and daughter reportedly both put in $10 million to secure the land, which was being sold as a single estate.</p><p>Kris’ younger daughter <a href=#>Kylie Jenner is also constructing a mega mansion</a> close to Kris and Khloe’s neighboring estates. The makeup mogul bought the property in 2020 for $15 million, only to tear down the existing structure and begin resurrecting her own custom mansion.</p><p>Additionally, Kris and Khloe both own properties within walking distance of each other in Hidden Hills; Khloe bought hers in October 2020 for $17 million, while Kris put down $20 million on her own property.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Tiger Woods Accused Of Sexual Harassment In Ex’s Million Dollar Lawsuit</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Insider</a>, <a href=#>Insider</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmakqpmoequxzaecq2WRmbqqwNJmq6hllqS%2FqLHTraCnn12dvLh5zJqlsmWYpLqmv4ysn55ln6y7tHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
