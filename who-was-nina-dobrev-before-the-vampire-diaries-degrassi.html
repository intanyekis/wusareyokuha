Hailing from Sofia, Bulgaria, before immigrating to Toronto and having a bit of a hard time pursuing post-secondary education. Here's how Nina Dobrev's life looked before The Vampire Diaries, and what's next for the Hollywood heavyweight.</p><h2 id=nina-dobrev-hailed-from-eastern-europe><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Nina Dobrev Hailed From Eastern Europe</span></h2><p>Nina Dobrev was born in January 1989 in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, before relocating with her family to Canada at the tender age of two. Artistry runs in her family's blood, as she was born from an artistic mother. Her father, Kamen, was fresh out of the Bulgarian army before eventually saving enough money to bring the whole family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"My mom crossed into Canada to meet him at Niagara Falls with one suitcase and a kid in each hand," she recalled during an interview with Self.

She joined Canadian actor Dean Armstrong's acting school in Toronto before subsequently enrolling at the School of Arts at Wexford Collegiate. At the age of 10, she faced a dilemma between acting or gymnastics, although we all know what she ended up choosing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It was either continue with the gymnastics and try to go to the Olympics, or audition more. Gymnastics was four hours a day, six days a week. There wasn't time for both," she recalled during the Self interview, "I would take the subway and then four different buses. Nothing was ever handed to me."</p><p>During her time on Degrassi, Dobrev also majored in sociology at Ryerson University, although she'd never graduated due to her hectic filming schedule.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Things Most People Don't Know About The Making Of The Vampire Diaries</a></span></p><h2 id=nina-dobrev-on-39-degrassi-39><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Nina Dobrev On 'Degrassi'</span></h2><p>Nina Dobrev got her first taste of fame with the teen series Degrassi: The Next Generation where she played the role of teen mom Mia Jones for three seasons. According to her storyline, Mia left the series in 2008 to pursue her full-time modeling career in Paris, although the actress jumped on The CW's The Vampire Diaries a year later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It was challenging because it’s not me. I went to a lot of web sites that dealt with teenage pregnancy.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> I read a lot of stories about girls having to go through what Mia di</a>d," she said in an interview, "There’s the alienation factor and there are all the stories and rumors, having everybody judge you.

She headlined several indie and television films in Canada, including the film adaptation of Anne Michael's war novel Fugitive Pieces, MTV's musical hit The American Mall, and Sarah Polley's directorial debut Away from Her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It's my first American thing, it was the lead, there was a lot of pressure but good pressure. It was something I was very excited about. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I couldn't sleep because I was so excited to start my first day at work</a>," the then-19-year-old recalled her American debut in an interview.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Nina Dobrev Has Done Some Wonderful Things To Support Boyfriend Shaun White's Snowboarding Career</a></span></p><h2 id=nina-dobrev-in-music-videos><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Nina Dobrev In Music Videos</span></h2><p>Nina Dobrev has starred in at least two music videos throughout her career so far. She made her debut in the accompanying video for indie duo Wade Allain-Marcus and David Baum's "You Got That Light" from their 2009 EP of the same name. The video, which tapped Brent Geisler and Jack Allred as the director-producer pair, didn't even break to 20,000 views on YouTube.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This wasn't the only music video Nina has been involved with, though. She re-joined her Degrassi cast Stefan Brogren, Lauren Collins, Cassie Steele, Miriam McDonald, and more in Drake's single "I'm Upset" from the Scorpion album.</p><h2 id=what-39-s-next-for-nina-dobrev><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What's Next For Nina Dobrev?</span></h2><p>So, what's next for this Hollywood starlett? The 33-year-old shows no sign of slowing down anytime soon, and if anything, she should have had a solid acting career after departing The Vampire Diaries. Since then, she has been around Hollywood, picking some romantic roles in the meantime, but her career is still far from its peak. She's been diving more into film roles and withdrawing herself from TV projects, but sadly, almost none of them was a blockbuster hit except for 2017's Return of Xander Cage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nina's career is still far from obscurity, though. She has several projects on her horizon, including an upcoming comedy Sick Girl.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Have Nina Dobrev's Recent Acting Gigs Stinted Her Earning Potential</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddrK60ec2ipZpllKSvs7HVZpmenp%2Bnsm7Ax55kr5mdpbazsYydoJqqmZrAbrDEoKmaq6OefA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
