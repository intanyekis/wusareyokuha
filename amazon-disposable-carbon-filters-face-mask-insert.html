The COVID-19 pandemic has proven to be very unpredictable, and as usual, it’s a good rule of thumb to exercise extra caution whenever possible.</p><p>That means concealing your nose and mouth with a suitable covering while entering a public space and always following the social distancing guidelines (at least six feet apart, people!). If you want to throw in an added later of protection, these <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">disposable carbon filters</a> will do just the trick.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Zoyeah-Activated-Carbon-Mask-Filters.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoyeah </a></strong><span id=productTitle class=a-size-large><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Activated Carbon Mask Filter</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">s</a> with free shipping for prices starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$30</a>, available at Amazon!
