Court documents obtained by Radar Online on Friday (April 28) reveal that Thomas Weidenmuller — a security guard who first sued the couple in 2022 for an assault that allegedly happened during a Nicki Wrld Tour show in Frankfurt, Germany, back in 2019 — has made a motion for the court to grant a default judgment in his favor, since the Pettys have failed to respond to the suit."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, he has not yet obtained a default judgment against Minaj’s husband.</p><p>According to Weidenmuller, the alleged skirmish happened when a fan breached the security barricade and got onstage while the Pink Friday rapper was putting on her show. Though Minaj’s personal security team managed to escort the fan offstage less than 15 seconds later, Minaj and Petty allegedly confronted Weidenmuller and his team about the incident after the show.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Nicki Minaj then allegedly called a female security guard on Weidenmuller’s team a “fucking bitch” and began blasting her live on social media. That’s when Weidenmuller stepped in and escorted the female security guard away from the situation. He claims he then went to Minaj’s dressing room to address the issue and Petty allegedly punched him in the face as Minaj began cursing.</p><p>Weidenmuller also alleged that Minaj directed Petty to attack him, thus prompting the suit for “battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligence,” per the outlet.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>This isn’t the first time that <a class=underline-link href=#>Kenneth Petty has landed Nicki Minaj in hot water</a> by association. Back in December 2022, Petty was ordered to settle <a class=underline-link href=#>his ongoing lawsuit with Jennifer Hough</a>, who accused him of harassing her in an attempt to curtail her rape allegation against him.</p><p>Hough initially sued Nicki Minaj as well, claiming <a class=underline-link href=#>the rapper took part in trying to intimidate her</a>, although those charges were eventually dropped.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/04/nicki-minaj-vaccine-bill-congressman-250x142.jpg alt="Nicki Minaj: Vaccine Bill Named After Rapper Introduced In Congress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Nicki Minaj: Vaccine Bill Named After Rapper Introduced In Congress</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>April 18, 2023</p></a><p>Judge James R.
