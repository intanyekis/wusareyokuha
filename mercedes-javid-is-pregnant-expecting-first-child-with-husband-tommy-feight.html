You feel really great one moment and then terrible another moment. That’s the reason why I share because, in my Instagram Stories for instance, I’ll say, ‘I don’t feel good today, but I want everyone else to know not to beat themselves up, to be kind to yourself and know that those days happen to everyone.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Javid added: “That’s how we connect to people, is if you’re going through something and you and I share that, [that’s] how much we just closed the gap between the two of us.”</p><p>Shahs of Sunset airs on Bravo Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGamnaKYsqWx0mahmq6ZmXqqv4ypqZ6fnpa7tXnEsaeem6Seu6h5xaKprKxdmLWquMNmrqKsmGK1tr%2FBmqWdZaSkuq7FjJ%2Bcop%2BYqXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
