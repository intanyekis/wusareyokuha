Comedians such as <strong>Jeff Ross </strong>and<strong> Nikki Glaser</strong> also <a href=#>joined in on the fun with digs</a> at Brady’s career and personal life.</p><p>However, Ross’ attempt to make a joke about how the conversation between the Patriots owner and Brady when the quarterback was drafted in 2000 didn’t go over so well.</p><p>“‘I’m the best decision your organization has ever made,'” Ross said while pretending to be Brady. “‘Would you like a massage?'”</p><p>Ross’ joke referenced Kraft being charged in 2019 for soliciting another to commit prostitution. The legal trouble was part of a police investigation that involved massage parlors in Florida. Kraft was ultimately cleared off all charges.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/What-Upset-Tom-Brady-Said-to-Jeff-Ross-Off-After-Robert-Kraft-Massage-Joke-2.jpg><p>Brady <a href=#>didn’t seem thrilled</a> with Ross’ humor, walking up to the podium to shut the topic down. “Don’t say that s—t again,” Brady told Ross, who replied, “OK, OK. [Robert is] having fun, look at him.”</p><p>Ross was the second person to take the stage on Sunday, with <strong>Kevin Hart</strong> kicking off the night with jokes about Brady’s marriage to <strong>Gisele Bündchen</strong>.</p><p>“Gisele gave you an ultimatum. She said you have to retire or you’re done. But when you have a chance to go 8-9 you gotta do it,” Hart said.</p><p>The comedian continued by joking that Brady “f–ked” coach Belichick, 72, when he left the New England Patriots for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p><p>“You f–ked him good. You did, Tom, you f–ked your coach, but let me tell you something people … that’s what you’ve got to do to maintain your happiness. You sometimes got to f–k your coach. You know who else f–ked their coach? Gisele. She f–ked that karate man,” Hart said in reference to Bündchen’s romance with her jiu-jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Hart added: “I mean Jesus Christ, Tom. One of the smartest quarterbacks ever played a game. How did you not see this coming? Eight f–king karate classes a day. … Eight karate classes a day and she’s still a white belt. F–k Tom. The only bruises she had were on her ass. everybody should have known it.”</p><p>Brady and Bündchen, 43, <a href=#>announced their divorce in October 2022</a> after more than a decade of marriage. The exes share son Benjamin, 14, and daughter Vivian, 11. Brady also shares son Jack, 16, <a href=#>with his ex <strong>Bridget Moynahan</strong>.</a></p><p>The Roast of Tom Brady is now streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuopV2Xv6Kw2Gaqoa2kqHqlu9anZKunkpq%2FtXnKq5ifrF2irrS%2FwKCcZqKfoLJurdNmpZ6slqG2uXnRqJisrF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
