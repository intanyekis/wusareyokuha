During a recent episode of Math Hoffa’s&nbsp;My Expert Opinion,&nbsp;Bobby spoke about <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>his partner in rhyme’s</a> comments regarding <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>King Von’s murder</a> and attempted to clarify his meaning.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I felt like that sh*t came out wrong,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the “Shmoney” rapper pleaded</a>. “He meant it in a good way, like that he wished that none of that sh*t would’ve happened because he’s a fan of both. But sometimes, you can’t talk on other people’s sh*t. Period. Rowdy knows he’s in the wrong for that.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Bobby, 28, continued, expressing that it was Rebel’s “emotions” that possessed him to speak on <a href=# id=auto-tag_lul-tim data-tag=lul-tim>Lul Tim</a> allegedly shooting at Von.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“It’s like sometimes these emotions are going to come out. So when emotions are high, you don’t want to talk on situations. Sometimes, you gotta say, ‘Man, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I just wish the best for everybody.</a>‘ And that’s it. Keep it at that. Shut the f**k up and don’t say sh*t about the situation.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GettyImages-1307310307.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Rebel, 31, previously appeared on&nbsp;My Expert Opinion&nbsp;in late Nov. 2022, where he spoke at length about Lul Tim, insinuating that he had “no morals” for shooting at Von back in 2020.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Everybody that’s dying out there is because there’s no ni**a to be like, ‘Nah, my fault. I’m sorry,'” said the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GS9 signee and affiliate</a> during his sit down with Math Hoffa.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“When <a href=# id=auto-tag_king-von data-tag=king-von>King Von</a> died, that&nbsp;Lul Tim&nbsp;ni**a, he didn’t have to get out of the car and start squeezing right away. His mind off the rip went to kill. How you went to kill? How much hate do you have already to kill this man?”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Rebel’s appearance on the talk show went viral, prompting the “Who Nina” rapper to respond to the internet’s criticism regarding his comments. The NYC-native posted to his stories on Monday (Dec. 5), doubling down on his stance regarding Lul Tim: “I said what I said.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He then clarified that while his stance may differ from Bobby’s, there was no “beef,” and he declared that he could never beef with someone who fought for his freedom from prison.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I [could] never beef with my brother Bobby,” Rowdy’s story read. “He freed me from a whole bid.
