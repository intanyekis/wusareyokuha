Meyers, 47 — who joined the cast as Randy Pearson for the show’s final season in 2005 — recalled the moment during a Wednesday, November 29, appearance on the “Podcrushed” podcast.
“The last scene of That ’70s Show was New Year’s Eve 1979,” Meyers explained. “It was a very hard scene for the cast to get through, because they had done this show for so long, and it’s emotional when you get to the end of a show."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Then, just when the cast was getting it together, there was a noise on set.</p><p>“They had sort of hit a stride, and it was like, ‘This is the shot, this is the take.’ And a phone rang,” Meyers claimed. “It was to Demi Moore. And she took the call! And the director was like, ‘What?'”</p><p>Meyers was impressed by Moore’s confidence. “She was like, ‘Yeah, hello?’ and we had to do it again. It was really amazing,” the MADtv alum said. “I mean, no disrespect, Demi, but … it’s a pretty high-level Hollywood flex to take that call in that situation.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/That-70-s-Show-s-Josh-Myers-Says-Demi-Moore-Ruined-Emotional-Finale-Scene-By-Taking-a-Phone-Call-698.jpg><p>At the time of the phone call fiasco, Moore, 61, was married to <strong>Ashton Kutcher</strong>, who played lovable himbo Michael Kelso on the sitcom. Moore announced the duo’s separation in 2011, noting in a statement: “It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that I have decided to end my six-year marriage to Ashton.” The exes <a href=#>finalized their split</a> in 2013.</p><p>Moore opened up about her history with Kutcher, 45, in <a href=#>her 2019 memoir</a>, Inside Out. In the tell-all, she claimed that Kutcher had been unfaithful to her and revealed that she relapsed during their relationship.</p><p>“Ashton was enjoying a glass of good red wine when he said, ‘I don’t know if alcoholism is a real thing — I think it’s all about moderation,’” Moore wrote. “I wanted to be that girl. The girl who could have a glass of wine at dinner, or do a tequila shot at a party. In my mind, Ashton wanted that too.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Kutcher later recalled feeling <a href=#>“f–king pissed” about the memoir</a> during a January interview with GQ. After his split from Moore, Kutcher moved on with his That ’70s Show costar <strong>Mila Kunis</strong>. The twosome tied the knot in 2015 and welcomed daughter Wyatt and son Dimitri in 2014 and 2016, respectively.</p><p>Moore, for her part, shares daughters Rumer, 35, Scout, 32, and Tallulah, 29, with ex-husband<strong> Bruce Willis</strong>. Moore has maintained an amicable relationship with Willis, 68, since their 2000 divorce and has been a source of support for the actor since his 2022 <a href=#>aphasia diagnosis</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGoq5hiuqbFxKuqZquRrsBusMSmoGaln6S%2FpnnRrqCnnZRiwamt02ZuaatdqLWww4yfoKeZnJp6tK%2FEp5xo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
