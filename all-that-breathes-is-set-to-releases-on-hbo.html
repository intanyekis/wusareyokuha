The teaser tells the entire story of the documentary, which is about two brothers who have dedicated their lives to protecting kites, as well as the difficulties, beauty, and relationships that all living beings share. This is one of the most anticipated documentary titles in recent memory, with rave reviews from all over the world.</p><h2>There is no distinction between things that breathe in the trailer for All That Breathes</h2><p>The visual wonder of All That Breathes, as seen in the teaser, can be described in one word: “breathtaking.” Shaunak Sen’s documentary on living creatures and their connections appears to have every shot meticulously chosen. The unusual theme of kites in the documentary attempts to touch on a much larger picture of humanity.</p><p>According to HBO’s official website, the documentary is as follows:</p><p><strong>“Shaunak Sen’s film All That Breathes follows two brothers who run a bird hospital dedicated to saving injured black kites, which are common in New Delhi’s sky. Thousands of these fascinating animals fall every day from New Delhi’s smog-choked sky in one of the world’s most densely populated cities, where cows, rats, monkeys, frogs, and pigs coexist with humanity.”</strong></p><p>It continues, saying:</p><p><strong>“As the city’s environmental toxicity and civic unrest worsen, this family’s relationship with the neglected kites becomes a lyrical record of the city’s deteriorating ecological and widening social fault lines.”</strong></p><p>All That Breathes, set in Delhi, will almost certainly address one of the most pressing issues on environmentalists’ minds in recent years: the city’s ecological collapse.</p><p>Over many years, pollution, water shortages, and unexplained carelessness have dominated Delhi, and it has become one of the most-discussed topics in recent years, with many arguing that it is too late for India’s capital to recover. Shaunak Sen’s documentary was made in collaboration with HBO Documentary Films, Submarine Deluxe, and Sideshow Release.</p><p>The critically acclaimed film made its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2022. It won the Grand Jury Prize in the World Cinema Documentary Competition. It was also selected for a special screening area at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival, where it was awarded the Golden Eye. Following its success, the film was nominated for an Academy Award.</p><p>In the previous 20 years, Nadeem Shehzad and Mohammad Saud, two brothers who run a bird clinic in Wazirabad, Delhi, have treated over 20,000 raptors. Shaunak Sen explained why he planned to shoot the brothers:</p><p><strong>“I am drawn to the topic of the interconnectedness of an ecosystem – one in which people are a part of, not separate from. How humans and animals coexist and merge. It’s a significant story.”</strong></p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/lenny-kravitz-girlfriend-gay-children-race/"}{"1":50}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children</a></span></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>All That Breathes</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>PewDiePie And Marzia Kjellberg Are Expecting Their First Child</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Darnell Ferguson Will Host The Upcoming Tv Show “Superchef Grudge Match”</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVflrmtedOhmK1lkqeyosDHnqpmoaNiwKbAjK2mZqqVobKiv8SsZKimXZ2vsHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
