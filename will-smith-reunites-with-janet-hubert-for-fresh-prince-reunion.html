So we’re doin’ something for y’all… <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a for real Banks Family Reunion</a> is comin’ soon to @HBOmax! RIP James. #FreshPrince30th,” Smith <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">captioned</a> the post. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">James Avery </a>— who portrayed patriarch Philip Banks on the hit sitcom — died in 2013.</p><p>Fans were shocked to see Smith and Hubert — who originally played Aunt Vivian — reunited for the first time in 27 years and appearing to be on good terms. “Will Smith and OG Aunt Viv (Janet Hubert) for the Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air reunion. Hell done froze over!” one person <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Will-Smith-Reunites-With-Original-Aunt-Viv-Actress-Fresh-Prince-Reunion-001.jpg><p>Another fan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>, “Will Smith and Janet Hubert in the same room … and she’s not slapping the taste out of his mouth. 2020 has truly been a year of s–t I would’ve never seen coming.”</p><p>A third person <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">joked</a>, “I’m pretty sure Will Smith and Janet Hubert making up was one of the signs in the book of Revelations.”</p><p>Hubert, 64, departed Fresh Prince of Bel-Air in 1993 after she and Smith<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> had difficulties working together on set. </a>The actress was replaced with Reid, 72, for the final three seasons.</p><p>Hubert told TMZ in 2011 that she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had no plans to reunite with Smith</a> because of their tumultuous relationship.</p><p>“There will never be a reunion … as I will never do anything with an a–hole like Will Smith,” she said at the time. “This constant reunion thing will never ever happen in my lifetime unless there is an apology, which he doesn’t know the word.”</p><p>The General Hospital actress later criticized Smith and his wife, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jada Pinkett Smith</strong></a>, in 2016 after they announced their plan to boycott the Academy Awards <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">due to a lack of diversity</a> in that year’s nominations.</p><p>However, the I Am Legend star only had nice things to say about Hubert’s portrayal of Aunt Viv one month later.</p><p>“I think that both of the Aunt Vivs were really, really fantastic,” Smith said during an interview with BBC Radio 1Xtra. “I think when you make a show, anytime you make a change, it’s going to be excruciating and painful. I think that Janet Hubert Whitten brought a really powerful dignity to the show.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He added, “I think she’s brilliant. I think as an artist, there’s so many things that she does: She sings, she dances, she’s like a really powerful artist. So I loved what she brought to The Fresh Prince.”</p><p>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air reunion special is set to premiere in November on HBO Max.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK6ipJxiwK6106Fkq52lo7a1sdJmrqKsmGK3orrErWShrZKav7V5xaipZp6imsCpec%2BroKeblWK%2FpsHNoqanZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
