Fans noticed that he has “Draya” tattooed in cursive on his lower stomach directly beneath a larger tattoo that reads “Believe In Yourself.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The 2022 <a href=#>NBA</a> All-Rookie Team honoree has not publicly acknowledged the pregnancy, but internet detectives have uncovered that he must feel strongly for his future baby’s mother due to this choice in ink.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Fans learned that Jalen Green was the father of Draya Michele’s forthcoming third child thanks to Washington Wizards forward <a href=#>Kyle Kuzma</a>. “It’s up familyyy @jalen @drayamichele,” Kuz wrote in the comments of Michele’s pregnancy announcement Instagram post. Notably, she turned off the comments of the post after the fact.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“As women, we navigate through so much, often leading us to question, ‘What is my purpose?’ For me, the magic lies in motherhood and the awe-inspiring ability to bring life into this world over the span of two decades,” she wrote in the caption of her maternity photoshoot.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“We are overjoyed to share our love for you, little girl. I’m excited to speak words to the daughter I never thought I’d have. We are anxious about your arrival, but take your time — this world can be tough. But know you are being brought into a space of love, security, and adornment.” Her first daughter is set to be born in May.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">One of the immediate reactions to Draya’s announcement was the fact that Jalen Green is the same age as her 22-year-old son. “Draya really tried to use International Women’s Day to announce her pregnancy as if we don’t know she was a deadbeat to her first son, and is now pregnant by a 22-year-old who’s the same age as her son while she’s pushing 40,” one user wrote.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Green and Michele were rumored to have been dating since 2023. Michele’s other two children are Kniko, whose father’s identity has been withheld from the public, and Jru, who she had with former NFL player Orlando Scandrick.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2BurbHNZp6rnZWjerWt062mqKtdmb%2BixcBmpKKbmJq5pnnNmqSeZWFngHWElWlvbG9f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
