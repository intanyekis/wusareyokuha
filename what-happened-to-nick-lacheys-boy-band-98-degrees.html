It's been a while since the group was huge, and fans want to see where they are today.</p><p>Let's take a look at Lachey and 98 Degrees!</p><h2 id=nick-lachey-is-doing-great-work-on-netflix>Nick Lachey Is Doing Great Work On Netflix</h2><p>These days, Nick Lachey is a popular figure on Netflix thanks to hosting duties on shows like Love is Blind and The Ultimatum. Lachey had done television work prior to linking up with Netflix, but things have hit an all-time high in recent years.</p><p>Shortly before season two of Love is Blind, Lachey opened up about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hosting the show</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I enjoy it so much because I get to work with my wife. It's such a blast for us to work together, and, at least I think, we work well together. We enjoy spending time together. We look at it as almost a mini vacation when we get to hang out together and be a part of a show we're really proud of. We did Season 1, not knowing if this was going to resonate with people at all, and to see the success it had, to get brought back for a Season 2, [I'm] thrilled to be a part of it. Every cast is different, every group of people is different," Lachey said.</p><p>Long before Lachey was holding it down on Netflix, he was part of the boy band craze that dominated the late '90s and early 2000s.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Whatever Happened To Jennifer Lopez's Son From 'Maid In Manhattan'?</a></span></p><h2 id=39-98-degrees-39-enjoyed-decent-success>'98 Degrees' Enjoyed Decent Success</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Formed in 1996, 98 Degrees was one of the most popular boy bands on the planet during their biggest years in the music business. Much like Backstreet Boys and NSYNC, the group had a ton of chart success, amassing a global audience in the process.</p><p>Featuring Nick and Drew Lachey, Jeff Timmons, and Justin Jeffre, 98 Degrees could do it all in the studio. Sure, they were probably best known for their ballads, but they had plenty of upbeat tracks that fans loved.</p><p>The group is estimated to have sold over 10 million records globally, with 8 of their hits cracking the top 40 stateside. The group even cracked the top 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 several times, notably hitting the top spot with "Thank God I Found You," a collaboration with Mariah Carey.</p><p>It's been some time since the group was a powerhouse, and fans want to know what happened to them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Whatever Happened To The Fiji Water Girl From The Golden Globes?</a></span></p><h2 id=39-98-degrees-39-is-still-making-music>'98 Degrees' Is Still Making Music</h2><p>So, what is 98 Degrees up to these days? Incredibly, after a quarter century in the game, the group is still together and touring to entertain their global fan base.</p><p>Fans were totally caught by surprise when the group dropped some fresh music last year, and Jeff Timmons spoke about the song <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in an interview</a>.</p><p>"We were traditionally known as balladeers and when we came back, we were trying too hard. We adopted a different sound and it didn’t really translate. We went with a label that had a different angle for us that they thought would be amazing and it didn’t work. This time, we were like, ‘look, how can we adopt the current sound while being true to what our sound is?’ and we felt that this exemplified exactly that," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In that same interview, Timmons dished on the group's remarkable longevity.</p><p>"It is such a blessing to be able to do this. I started the group to meet girls, get famous and make money, you know the things that young guys think about, and the music was in there as well. Never did I think in my late 40s would I be going out releasing music to radio and performing for sold-out crowds. I never thought it would last that long. I was doing it for fun and had the vision that we would we would be doing it then like that, but not this much later in my career and my life. I would never take it for granted," Timmons said.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Whatever Happened To Belinda From 'A Walk To Remember'?</a></span></p><p>If you're itching for the boy bands of yesteryear, then take a listen to some new 98 Degrees and catch them when they come to a town near you.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Whatever Happened To Leo From 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen'?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brrInKJmpJGYtabF0maZqLFdl66vsIxyb2aclZy%2FprHSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
