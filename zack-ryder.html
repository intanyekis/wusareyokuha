Zack started his wrestling career in 2004 as a member of the New York Wrestling Connection, then moved on to the WWE in 2005. His first appearance in the WWE was on April 21, 2005 on Smackdown.&nbsp;During this period he was still going by his real name, and was quickly renamed “Brett Majors.” His regular wrestling partner was renamed “Bryan Majors,” and they became successful tag-team partners. In 2009, he completely changed his look and went by the ring name “The Long Island Loudmouth”: deep tan, bleached tips, sunglasses. His catchphrase was “woo woo!” By 2011, he entered a period called “The Ryder Revolution.” That was short lived, when he began falling back to lower tier status in 2012. Zack became the WWE Intercontinental Champion after winning WrestleMania 32 on April 3, 2016.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><span class=celeb_profile_label>Best Known For:</span><br>Zack is best known for being a WWE champion.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><span class=celeb_profile_label>Personal Life:</span><br>Zack is dating Australian WWE wrestler Emma, real name <strong>Tenille Dashwood</strong>.
