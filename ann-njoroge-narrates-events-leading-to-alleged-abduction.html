She was also informed that she had sold her oil to another company, a claim she says is false.</p><p>“I went to record a statement at the DCI after being informed I had sold my oil to another company, which was false. When I was there, I was put into a vehicle and escorted to another place where I was locked up,” she said.</p><p>She also revealed that the officers demanded that she alters her statement. She also told reporters that documents showing ownership of the oil are legit as opposed to Kenya Ports Authority’s earlier statements.</p><p>“I have not forged any documents; all documents linked to my business are legit.”</p><b>Email your news TIPS to Editor@kahawatungu.com or WhatsApp +254707482874</b><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmijkZ2uuK3TrqWgrV6YvK57wKelZqaapL%2Bws8RmpZqqopbBpr%2BMnq2epqSoeq2xwJ2gp59dqbxurculnKCdlGKuo7DUnKuip55k</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
