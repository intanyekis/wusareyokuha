He discussed the new project with Mashable;</p><p>"There wasn't really anything happening in our area, so I kind of stood by. I waited a couple of days, and was starting to get a little stir crazy," Fieri explained. "I was talking with my team at Knuckle Sandwich, and I said, 'I've gotta do something.' We were having a conversation about restaurants being closed, so I said, 'How do we make money for the employees?' The more people we talked to and the more time we spent talking, the bigger it blew up. It was really just like a jam session with your buddies. We were sitting around trying to figure out what we could do to make things better."</p><p>As for Gordon Ramsay, he’s excited to reopen some his restaurant, of course with new policies in place;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Our team's health and safety are just as important as yours, and that's why they will be getting regular temperature checks before and after every shift. As well as new health and safety training behind the scenes. Most importantly, from the bottom of my heart, we can't wait to have you back in our restaurants to bring you the same excitement that we have bought you before."</p><p>Okay, so enough of the positivity! Did Ramsay really take a shot at Guy? We’ll let you guys decide.</p><h2 id=the-tweet>The Tweet</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It was a response to a tweet that broke the door wide open.</a> A Twitter user wrote, “I really wish @GuyFieri talked to people the same way @GordonRamsay does.” Surprisingly, Ramsay answered the tweet, writing, “I don’t think Flavortown allows it.”</p><p>Fans had fun with the tweet as hundreds of comments followed. Some fans saw it as honest fun while others came up with the theory that Ramsay was indirectly calling Fieri and his crew a bunch of softies with the way they deal with restaurants and their affairs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, what do you guys think, water under the bridge or a direct shot from Gordon Ramsay?</p><p>Fieri never responded to the tweet, though he has made a comment pertaining to Ramsay’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kitchen Nightmares</a> in the past.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">No More Kitchen Nightmares: Here’s What Gordon Ramsay Has Said About Getting Fit</a></span></p><h2 id=fieri-talks-chef-ramsay>Fieri Talks Chef Ramsay</h2><p>Clearly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">closing down restaurants isn’t Guy Fieri’s thing.</a> During his interview on the Today Show, he was emotional discussing the closure of a Scottsdale restaurant, which took place thanks to Gordon’s Kitchen Nightmares;</p><p>“I heard about this. It's tough, you know, I'm a chef first, and a restaurant owner, way before I was ever on Food Network, and it's a tough business. And Gordon's show is a lot different than Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. I go to places and say, 'Check out this dish. It's great.' So this whole dynamic that's taking place and how it's escalated... I'm actually in awe.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fieri made it clear that two have different approaches, especially when it comes to both television and food in general. Aside from the brief statement, Fieri has kept quiet pertaining to his relationship/rivalry with the popular chef.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How Food Network Contributed To Guy Fieri’s $20 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=gordon-does-have-a-soft-side>Gordon Does Have A Soft Side</h2><p>Some might argue that Ramsay and Fieri don’t get along due to the fact that they have different personalities. However, what few discuss is the fact that Ramsay, like Guy, also has a softer side. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">That is evidenced by Ramsay’s friendship alongside David Beckham. </a>Gordon spoke candidly about their relationship with Hello Magazine;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I ruptured my Achilles a few years back, and that injury was one of the worst things that have ever happened to me," he shared. "Luckily, David Beckham gave me advice on the recovery. I keep my mindset super positive and remember there’s a reward waiting on the other side of sacrifice. I have a three-second rule I live by, If a negative comes into my mind, I listen to it, process it, then get rid of it. Over the past ten years, we've naturally got on. I see how hard David and Victoria work. But the connection is our ambition to get all eight children through school, college, university, and then dust ourselves down, when the kids are in their 20s, as having been decent parents. That's hard. We feed off each other. Three girls and a boy, and three boys and a girl – you'd be amazed at the synergy."</p><p>So perhaps the two aren’t as different as all the fans might assume, as Gordon certainly has a softer side away from his Kitchen Nightmares and Hell’s Kitchen shows.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT –<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">16 Ways Gordon Ramsay Amassed His Reported $220 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Sources – Mashable, Hello Magazine, Eater & Twitter</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYq6zsYyqrJ6rpJ68r7XNoGSinl2YtaayjKuYpquRrnqzscClo7JlpKS8rHnAZpuin12WwW6z1LJkn6GVp7Zw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
