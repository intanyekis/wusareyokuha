She used scissors on Zahara’s black ponytail and then showed off Shiloh’s <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>new buzz cut</a>&nbsp;in two different photos. After the hair cuts, Angelina snapped an image of strands from both Zahara and Shiloh’s locks.

She serves as a Special Envoy for the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>United Nation’s commission for refugees</a> and has testified on Capitol Hill on several occasions. She showed major support for Iranian women in September 2022 who protested the death of 22-year-old <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Mahsa Amini</strong></a>. Mahsa died after being detained by Iran’s morality police for wearing her hijab too loosely. Authorities maintained she died of natural causes, while her body showed signs of brutality postmortem.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“Women don’t need their morals policed, their minds re-educated, or their bodies controlled,” Angelina declared on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> at the time, alongside photos of the protests. “They need the freedom to live and breathe without violence or threats.” Ending with a message of solidarity, she wrote, “To the women of Iran, we see you.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ze5FqZpqml5q5qrrAZqGopJmaeqTB06xknZmlnLW1sdGsZKGZmad6or7TZpyxoJmXtrW1zqdksKedmrtutdGapWaomKTBsL%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
