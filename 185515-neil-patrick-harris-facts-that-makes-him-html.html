I Image: Getty Images.</p><p class=Zg>Like millions of LGBTQA teenagers, Harris once struggled to let his own family know that he was gay, and according to his brother Brian, Harris sat down with his folks in <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/neil-patrick-harris-is-naked-on-the-new-cover-of-rolling-stone-186570/>three different occasions</a> to gradually reveal his sexual identity.</p><p class=Zg>“First he goes, ‘I just don’t think I’m going to date, really, for a while.’ And he had some bad luck with the girls he dated early on. Probably because he was gay!” Brian recalled.</p><p class=Zg>“And then we had a different conversation about how he likes girls, but he kind of likes guys too. And we had another conversation after that: He likes guys,” the star’s sibling added.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Neil Patrick Harris.

Some actors don’t get hired because you can’t look into their soul and see what they’re like, because they’re kept guarded,” Harris shared.</p><p><h3 class=dh><strong class=Xg>RED BULL</strong></h3></p><p class=Zg>One thing which Harris has been also open about for a long time now is his love for the energy drink Red Bull, and he has been so insisting in his praise of the product that the company eventually felt drawn to offer him a gesture of appreciation.</p><p class=Zg>Considering the amount of free advertising that the brand had been enjoying from the Hollywood star, they responded by granting him <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://guardianlv.com/2014/04/neil-patrick-harris-things-you-may-not-know/>a life-long supply</a> of the drink.</p><p class=Zg>Not only he reportedly drinks a can of the beverage before every live show, but his love for the drink made it into “How I Met Your Mother,” with his character Barney Stinson is frequently seen with a can of Red Bull on him.</p><p><h3 class=dh><strong class=Xg>A RELATIONSHIP OF 15 YEARS</strong></h3></p><p class=Zg>While his coming of age years were a little chaotic as he made his way into adulthood exploring his sexuality in a series of sporadic and unsatisfying encounters that he kept hidden, he was lucky enough to find <a class="zd d" href=#>a lasting love</a>.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Neil Patrick Harris and his husband David Burtka.
