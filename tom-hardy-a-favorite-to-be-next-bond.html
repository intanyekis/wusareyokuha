It could certainly be a while until we get a final answer.</p><p>There are plenty of household names who've been linked to taking over as the next 007. Happy Valley and War & Peace star James Norton has been frequently listed as a betting favorite. Of course, Norton <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was quick to shut down the speculation</a> that he'll be the next Bond. Sam Heughan and Richard Madden are also among the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">other big-named stars who've been top betting favorites to replace Craig</a>.</p><p>Now, The Dark Knight Rises and The Revenant star Tom Hardy is making a surge in the betting odds. According to Ladbrokes (h/t the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Express</a>), Hardy now carries 6/1 odds of becoming the next 007 (his odds were previously set at 8/1).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pierce Brosnan Shares Rejected James Bond Pitch From Quentin Tarantino</a></strong></p><p>Hardy shares the odds with Aidan Turner, but Norton remains the primary betting favorite at 2/1, followed by Heughan at 3/1.</p><p>If Craig is truly stepping down as 007, the Bond series producers will have no shortage of compelling names to choose from. There were rumors that a female would be cast as the next Bond, but producer<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Barbara Broccoli has confirmed that a male will continue</a> to play the role.</p><p>Craig is the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">longest-tenured Bond actor ever</a>, assuming the role on Oct. 14, 2005. His first Bond film, Casino Royale, was released in 2006. That was followed by Quanton of Solace (2008), Skyfall (2012) and the aforementioned Spectre (2015).</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>The Rock's Daughter Has No Idea Her Dad Is Moana's Maui As They Sing-Along Together</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e9OopGagkaexunnAZp2arp%2BntrWxjK2mZpqVYrumxNNmmaimlGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
