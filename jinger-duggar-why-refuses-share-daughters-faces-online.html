But now that many of the couple’s children have kids of their own, they’re choosing to do things differently. Jinger Duggar recently opened up about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">why she keeps her two daughters off of social media</a>, despite being active online herself.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Jinger-Duggar-Vuolo-on-TLC.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Jinger Duggar Vuolo Chose Not To Participate In The Duggar Documentary For A Specific Reason">Jinger Duggar Vuolo Chose Not To Participate In The Duggar Documentary For A Specific Reason</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Jinger Duggar Vuolo had a relatable reason for choosing not to appear in the documentary series that dragged her family.</p><h2 id=why-jinger-keeps-her-daughters-rsquo-identities-private>Why Jinger Keeps Her Daughters’ Identities Private</h2><p>“I appreciate you guys respecting our wishes to keep their lives private and to not show their faces,” Jinger said during a Q&A on Instagram, thanking her followers for their understanding. “That’s something that we really feel strongly about in this season.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jinger has two daughters with her husband Jeremy Vuolo, Felicity, 5, and Evangeline, 3.</p><p>“Felicity is so much fun, she’s a strong personality but she’s always making us laugh. Life of the party,” the ex-reality star continued. “Evie Jo is doing amazing as well. She is super chill. She’s the opposite of Felicity and she loves a few close friends to play with and she’s content with that.”</p><p>The Duggar family, known for their conservative Christian beliefs and large brood, rose to fame with their TLC reality show 19 Kids and Counting, which aired in 2008. The show captivated viewers with the Duggars' unique lifestyle, including homeschooling, strict courtship rules, and devout religious practices.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, their fame took a hit in 2015 when it was revealed that Josh Duggar, the eldest son, had molested several young girls, including his sisters, as a teenager. This scandal led to the cancellation of the show. Later that year, Josh was implicated in the Ashley Madison data breach, admitting to infidelity and a pornography addiction, further tarnishing the family’s image.</p><h2 id=jinger-says-she-rsquo-s-not-returning-to-reality-t-v>Jinger Says She’s Not Returning To Reality T.V.</h2><p>Following the cancellation of the family’s show, Jinger and several family members transitioned to a new series, Counting On, which aired from 2015 until its cancellation in 2020.</p><p>In her memoir, Becoming Free Indeed, published in January 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jinger revealed that she was heartbroken</a> upon learning of Counting On’s end in 2021, admitting that she cried at the news. However, in February, Jinger addressed the possibility of returning to reality TV, ultimately disappointing fans by stating she has no plans to do so.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reflecting on her time on the show, she expressed, “I loved so many aspects of the show. The crew became like family and it provided so many opportunities for travel and [to] meet so many sweet people.”</p><p>While fans may miss being able to keep up with the Duggars, they shouldn’t expect to see Jinger’s family in close detail online, as she remains committed to keeping her girls out of the spotlight. And after her upbringing, who can blame her?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihoqaXmr9usNSgnpqqXay1unnRnp2uq5WoerS0wKucZpyRqrSpwMSrqmaekZiytHnOp6OippVk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
