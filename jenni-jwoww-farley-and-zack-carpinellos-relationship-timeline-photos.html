Us Weekly confirmed that the pair had reunited after a brief split on October 20, 2019, shortly after the Jersey Shore: Family Vacation star pulled the plug on their six-month-long relationship. JWoww ended things with the wrestler after the October 10 episode aired, showing Carpinello getting handsy with Farley’s costar Angelina Pivarnick."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

For 5 months I was naive, probably laughed at and made into a story line that will forever haunt me. My heart hurts on so many levels. One thing I learned from tonight’s episode is know your value. Don’t ever lower your standards.”</p><p>The following day, a source told Us that the mother of two “ended the relationship.”</p><p>The pair <a href=#>went public with their relationship</a> in April 2019, following Farley’s September 2018 split from <strong><a href=#>Roger Mathews</a></strong> after three years of marriage. The reality star shares two children with Mathews, daughter Meilani and son Greyson.</p><p>Farley raved about her relationship with Carpinello just weeks before their brief breakup. “I never in a million years thought I would be dating someone younger than me,” she said on the MTV reality show. “We’re completely different. Not my style at all.”</p><p>She also praised the athlete’s bedroom performance: “He turns into this f–king monster in bed. I was like, ‘Are you an escort? What’s going on?’ It wasn’t normal. I had to look up positions and stuff.”</p><p>The reality star confirmed in March 2021 that <a href=#>Carpinello proposed one month prior</a>.</p><p>Nearly two years later, the couple had yet to walk down the aisle. Farley exclusively told Us that the delay was a result of how much work goes into planning a wedding.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’m trying, then I’m not trying,” she said in January 2023. “I really wanna do it out of the country, but then to do that you gotta kind of … rely on people abroad to do it.”</p><p>Scroll down to see the couple’s relationship timeline.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt6a6zaJko6%2BfrMRussCro56xXZa7pXnZmpqkZZOWv7G1zZ6jpaejYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXnToqSepJmjsm68x6irqKtf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
