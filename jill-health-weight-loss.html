All you gotta do is follow four simple steps and not after long, you will reach your desired weight. Let's take a look at what those steps are:</p><h2>Step 1: Determine how much weight you need to lose!</h2><p>Jill Health Weight Loss program recommends you have a clear measured goal and know specifically how much weight you want to lose before you get started on your weight loss journey. And to set that goal, you need to have a discussion with your healthcare provider. You need to give them some body measurements such as your height, weight, and waist circumference so that they can determine which weight category you fall in.</p><p>Then, you need to tell them your goals and reasons for weight loss and accordingly, they may propose an ideal weight or set of measurements to aim for, after taking into consideration your BMI and waist circumference. Some blood work might be needed based on your medical history. Jill Health Weight Loss service also first determines people's BMI to check if they are eligible to continue with drug prescription or not.</p><h2>Step 2: Try other options before considering medications!</h2><p>But before determining which weight loss medication to take, make sure you have tried all the other non-drug options such as exercises, diet changes, and some medication changes (some meds such as antidepressants can cause you to gain weight). Do aerobic exercise for 30-60 minutes on most days of the week and do some resistance training.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/04/jill-health-exercise.jpg alt="Jill Health Weight Loss Program recommends you try dieting and exercising before taking drugs.

If these changes result in weight reduction, you don't need to take medications. Only after you have exhausted all those options and yet you can't manage to lose weight and you don't see any other way, Jill Health Weight Loss program recommends going for drugs.</p><h2>Step 3: Try weight loss medication!</h2><p>If you fail to lose weight even after trying out all the non-drug methods, only then try weight loss medication. You might need to go that way even if you have a significantly high BMI. Most medical teams will recommend medication if you have BMI over 27 and if you have other obesity-related complications like diabetes.</p><p>Jill Health Weight Loss program takes into account your pre-existing medical conditions, allergies, medications, and personal preference for specific products (ie. injectables vs oral pills) and determines what the best medication option is for you. Two common medications that Jill Health program uses are Saxenda (Liraglutide) and Contrave (Naltrexone/bupropion).</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/04/jill-health.jpg alt="Jill Health Weight Loss Program recommends either Saxenda or Contrave to lose weight. " width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Jill Health Weight Loss Program recommends either Saxenda or Contrave to lose weight.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Jill Health</strong></p><p>Saxenda works by slowing the emptying of your stomach and making you feel more full. You can reach your weight loss goal faster if you have reduced appetite and food cravings because you eat less that way. Saxenda is an injectable solution that should not be used by pregnant women, people who have a family history of medullary thyroid cancer, or endocrine neoplasia syndrome.</p><p>Contrave works when the ingredients of this weight loss medication act on the hypothalamus, an area in the brain that affects appetite regulation, and on the mesolimbic dopamine circuit, which plays a role in our reward system. This causes to decrease in appetite and that's how you lose weight. Contrave is an oral pill usually taken twice a day. It should not be used by pregnant women, people who have high blood pressure, seizure disorder, anorexia, long-term opioid use, and people who use bupropion-containing products, and during/within 14 days of using monoamine oxidase inhibitors.</p><h2>Step 4: Maintain your weight!</h2><p>After the use of weight loss medication, you will lose weight but that's not the end as per Jill Health. Your body will most likely try to regain what it has lost. So, even after you have reached your ideal goal weight, you need to continue with your lifestyle changes and regular follow-up appointments to ensure maintaining your body. If you are careful about what you consume and take medication appropriately, you can expect to lose 15% of your original body weight in a year in a healthy way.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGihoqScYrWmrcutn2avlZ60qcCMpaasq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
