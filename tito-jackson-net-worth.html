Nowadays he performs as a blues musician in clubs, being the last of the Jackson brothers to start a solo career.</p><p>So just how rich is Tito Jackson? His net worth has been estimated by authoritative sources at over $10 million, money made from music. Media were speculating a few years ago that all the Jacksons were in fact not as rich as they would like people to believe, and that Tito Jackson’s net worth would be closer to $2 million. Most of his earnings have come from touring, album sales and royalties: their tour in 1984 alone grossed over $70 million, which brought to the Jacksons about $36 million, or $7 million each. He compounds his earnings by performing soundtracks for several television series, and with appearances in television shows, series and documentaries. The singer owns a house in Woodland Hills, California.</p><h3>Tito Jackson Net Worth $10 Million</h3><p>Tito and his brothers started performing in 1964, and they became known after winning several talent shows, including The Apollo Theatre’s Amateur Night competition. The group became really famous after signing with Motown Records in 1969, and as The Jackson Five had a series of number one hits, including “ABC”, “I’ll Be There”, “The Love You Save”, and “I Want You Back”. The group signed a new contract in 1975 with Epic Records, and released five albums. In 1980, Tito Jackson and his brothers received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and, in 1997, all Jackson Five members were inducted into the Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Fame.</p><p>After 1990, the group stopped performing, and Tito went to work as the manager for his sons, who formed 3T, an R&B/pop music group. The singer only really started focusing on his solo career after 2003, and came back into the spotlight after the sudden death of his more famous brother, <a href=#>Michael Jackson</a>, in 2009, even if he tried to stay away from the media and their speculations.</p><p>However, Tito performed on the soundtrack of the television series “Strictly Come Dancing” and “Dancing on Ice”, and has appeared in several television documentaries and series, including “The Nation’s Favourite ’80s Number Ones” (2015), “The Big Reunion” (2014), “Loose Women” (between 2009 and 2013), “<a href=#>Michael Jackson</a>: The Inside Story-What Killed the King of Pop?” (2010), and “<a href=#>Michael Jackson</a>: The Immortal World Tour” (2012). He was also an executive producer for the first episode of “The Jacksons: A Family Dynasty”, in 2009.</p><p>In 2012, Tito added new earnings to his net worth when he and his brothers <a href=#>Marlon</a>, <a href=#>Jackie</a>, and <a href=#>Jermaine</a> started “The Unity Tour”, as a tribute to their dead brother <a href=#>Michael</a>. For more than a year, the group toured North America, Australia, Europe and Asia, performing in over 70 shows worldwide, which grossed more than $10 million.</p><p>More recently, in 2016 Tito Jackson achieved his first solo hit with “Get It Baby,” featuring <a title="Big Daddy Kane" href=#>Big Daddy Kane</a>, from his album “Tito Time”, finally becoming the ninth Jackson to score a solo single hit, and his album “Tito Time” was released later that year, including in the UK after a rather spectacular launch party.</p><p>In his personal life, Tito Jackson married Delores “Dee Dee” Martes in 1954 and the couple has three children. They divorced in 1993, one year before Delores’ murder.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=35.285073670724><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Tito Jackson</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>14th October 1953</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Gary, Indiana, United States</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Profession</td><td>Guitarist, Musician, Singer-songwriter, Multi-instrumentalist</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>University of New Hampshire</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Delores Martes Jackson (m. 1972–1993)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Children</td><td>Taryll Jackson, TJ Jackson, Taj Jackson</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Katherine Jackson, Joe Jackson</td></tr><tr readability=12><td>Siblings</td><td>Michael Jackson, Michael Jackson, Jermaine Jackson, Janet Jackson, Marlon Jackson, Michael Jackson, La Toya Jackson, Rebbie Jackson, Randy Jackson, Joh'Vonnie Jackson</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Nicknames</td><td>Toriano Adaryll Jackson , Tito , Papa T , Toriano Adaryll "Tito" Jackson</td></tr><tr readability=0.30769230769231><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/titojacksonofficial</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35897435897436><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/titojackson5</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.41860465116279><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/poppa3t/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0414099</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.24615384615385><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.allmusic.com/artist/tito-jackson-mn0000603763</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Awards</td><td>Hollywood Walk of Fame (1980), Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame (1997)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Record Labels</td><td>Steeltown, Epic Records, Motown Recoords</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Albums</td><td>Tito Time (2016), 2300 Jackson Street (1989), The Jacksons Live!
