On Saturday (December 4), vloggers Zias and B. Lou — owners of the ZIAS! YouTube channel — uploaded a “Super Gremlin” reaction video featuring Kodak himself.

Lou’s questions. At one point, he hunched over and closed his eyes as if he was about to fall asleep, before suddenly springing back up and shaking his head to wake himself up.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>When he did engage in conversation, Kodak’s speech was noticeably slurred and he came out with more bizarre quotes, such as comparing the experience of listening to “Super Gremlin” to taking crack.</p><p>“That shit is just, like, crazy, homie … That bitch just hit different when you play it,” he said. “It’s like every time you listen to that shit, that shit just do something. It’s like that bitch got crack in it, ya heard?”</p><p>He later clarified, “I don’t know ’cause I don’t smoke crack or none of that crazy shit, but it got some shit on that, boy.
