And after he posted a photo of the blonde model kissing him on the cheek, the cat was out of the bag.&nbsp;</p><p>Bieber’s ex <strong><a href=#>Selena Gomez</a></strong> recently shared a <a href=#>selfie on Instagram</a> with the caption, “I thought he only liked the Latina category. Smh… #nomakeup #hatewhengirlssaythat,” and Russo thinks the note was intentionally aimed at her.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=546 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="justin and selena" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“It was clearly directed at him with me in the video, but like I said I was just doing my job,” Russo said in a new interview with <a href=#>Cosmopolitan</a>. “Selena is a superstar and I’m just a girl in a video. She’s his ex, and I’m sure they still have feelings for each other.”</p><p>But anyone interested in acquiring the “Boyfriend” singer’s affections might have cause to be jealous. The 19-year-old video vixen reveals that they’re still in close communication. In fact, the singer is stored in Russo’s phone under an alias.&nbsp;</p><p>“If my phone is out and I’m with people, I don’t want anyone to see if he texts me or FaceTimes me, ya know?” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>But Russo reveals she does have a boyfriend, for the time being.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I had a boyfriend up until the video and the drop,” she continued. “We broke up for about a week after, but we’re back together… for now.”</p><p>Russo’s boyfriend didn’t stop her from shooting lots of passionate kissing scenes with Bieber throughout the music video.&nbsp;</p><p>“In the beginning it was kind of weird because I had never kissed anyone on set that passionately or that famous,” she said. “I wasn’t a super fan of his before I did this and I just kept thinking to myself that people would kill to do this. I got butterflies and I do still to this day. After the shoot wrapped it felt so surreal, I even got a speeding ticket after the shoot because I was on such a high. I guess you could say I wouldn’t mind doing it again.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajraOptq95waKcm52iqHquwdKimmaumZmysHnCq6ysoF2prq230maqnqSVo65us86mnLOrXZm2tL%2BMpKCsq5mjtG7Ax55krK2gmr%2B0wMCrZGtoYWiBcn6O</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
