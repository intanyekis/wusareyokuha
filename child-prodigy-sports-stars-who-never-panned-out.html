Undoubtedly,&nbsp;there is a level of beauty that exists in witnessing uncorrupted,&nbsp;precocious children excel in an adult domain. But&nbsp;throughout that process, future expectations are generated, i.e., a burden that can either glorify or pose a threat to&nbsp;the phenom's birth name and legacy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While child prodigies&nbsp;are assumed to able able to sustain their success and prosperity later on in adult life, the fact of the matter is, for every Mozart and Bobby Fisher there is also an Ervin Nyiregyhazie. We have unfortunately seen this happen far too often.</p><p>Unlike our predecessors, in today's day and age,&nbsp;technology and&nbsp;mainstream media have certainly played a factor, as well as destiny itself.&nbsp;Examining&nbsp;the prodigies that have emerged in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sports field</a>, roughly within the past centuries, here are 10 child prodigy sports stars who didn't pan out and 5 that did.</p><h2 id=never-panned-out---evan-berry><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Never Panned Out - Evan Berry</span></h2><p>According to Bleacher Report, back in 2009, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">13-year-old Evan Berry told Yahoo about his verbal commitment to attend the University of Tennessee and play football</a>. Determined to follow in his family's footsteps, Berry would go on to be true to his word.&nbsp;Though coach <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lane Kiffin</a> left for USC the following year, Berry played defensive back for the Volunteers from 2014-2017. Going undrafted, he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">signed with the Browns and was waived</a> just 3 months later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did---tara-lipinski><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Did - Tara Lipinski</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tara Lipinski</a> gained nationwide recognition when she competed in the 1994 U.S. Olympic Festival and became the youngest athlete to win the gold medal. The words "distinctive" and "precocious" can seem to best describe Lipinski as just the following year, at 13, Lipinski became <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the first female skater to land a triple loop/triple loop jump combination</a>, and in her later years, won numerous Professional Figure Skating championships.</p><h2 id=never-panned-out---toe-nash><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Never Panned Out - Toe Nash</span></h2><p>Playing in the Dixie youth tournament, a young Toe Nash immediately caught the attention of Tampa Bay Devil Ray scout Benny Latino. Years after losing track of him, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Latino took Nash to meet the rest of the Rays scouting department</a>. The staff couldn't help watching in awe after he hit towering home runs with both hands. Ultimately, arrests, fights, and a failed drug test led to his downfall as Nash was released by both the Reds and the Rays.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did---megan-kang><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Did - Megan Kang</span></h2><p>Megan Kang left the public with quite the impression when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Enterprise News wrote a piece on the young phenom</a>. Resonating with parents and children through her Hmong culture and strong family bond, nearly 11 years have passed since the issue was printed. Currently, Kang is 22 and since earning her LPGA Tour card in 2016, she has only progressed. Last year, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kang recorded a T8 at the Evian Championship</a> and has a Rolex golf ranking of 41.</p><h2 id=never-panned-out---jashaun-agosto><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Never Panned Out - Jashaun Agosto</span></h2><p>Jashaun Agosto can be remembered as the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">11-year-old who made news headlines for his incredible muscle memory</a> at such a young age, as well as appearing on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. As a teenager, he went to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Garfield High Scool and became a 3-star recruit</a>. Despite having above-average basketball skills, unlike most athletes, his growth spurt was limited. Standing at 5'11," he became a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">4-year starter at LIU</a> but never received an opportunity to play professionally.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did---wayne-gretzky><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Did - Wayne Gretzky</span></h2><p>Displaying a skill level far beyond his age, a 6-year-old Wayne Gretzky played against <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 year-olds on his Pee Wee hockey team in Brantford</a>. By his final year, the media began to take notice when he scored an impressive 378 goals. As it is well-known, the child prodigy grew up to be considered the greatest NHL player of all-time.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 NHL Players Wayne Gretzky Disliked (And 7 He Mentored)</a></span></p><h2 id=never-panned-out---cody-paul><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>&nbsp;Never Panned Out - Cody Paul</span></h2><p>Cody Paul's internet sensation all started when his brother posted highlights of him playing football for Los Alamitos Pop Warner Pee Wee Griffinson on Youtube. In a move that was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">intended for relatives in Utah,</a> the video went viral and placed the 12-year-old running back into early fame.&nbsp;By his 3rd year of high school, reality struck hard. Never growing past 5'5," Paul didn't receive any offers from major colleges and ended his football career with Chadron State.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did---tiger-woods><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Did - Tiger Woods</span></h2><p>Interviewed by sports anchor Jim Hill, Tiger Woods received his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">first media exposure at the early age of 2</a>. Given Wood's love for the game and the&nbsp;strong support system he had around him, such as his father and&nbsp;John Anselmo who helped him with his swing at age 10, Woods' accolades only accumulated over the years. He won the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Junior Amateur Championship twice</a>, and later on in adulthood, various PGA and Masters Tournament championships.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">8 People Tiger Woods Remains Close With (And 7 That Faded Away)</a></span></p><h2 id=never-panned-out---maria-shishkina><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Never Panned Out - Maria Shishkina</span></h2><p>Referring to&nbsp;her as "the next Maria Sharapova," in 2013, Trans World Sport conducted a profile interview on a then 12-year-old Maria Shishkina. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leaving Kazakhstan to attend the Nick Bollettieri Academy in Florida</a>, Sharapova began training with Bollettieri in hopes of achieving her tennis goals. Sadly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">two wrist surgeries</a> derailed her progression at 15, and shortly after being ranked at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">1102</a>&nbsp;in 2016, Sharapova disappeared from the public eye.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did---nadia-comaneci><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Did - Nadia Comaneci</span></h2><p>In the aftermath of her record-breaking performance at the Montreal 1976 Olympic Games, Nadia Comaneci's global recognition skyrocketed. The Romanian gymnast was just 14-years-old and had&nbsp;impressively <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">earned 7 perfect scores</a> — a record that no adult had ever broken in Olympic history — on the uneven bars and to this day, is the youngest Olympic all-around champion. Continuing her dominance in the 1980 Moscow games, she proceeded to capture two more gold medals.</p><h2 id=never-panned-out---dakota-simms><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>&nbsp;Never Panned Out - Dakota Simms</span></h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">compliments poured in by CBS Atlanta Sports anchors</a>. How could Dakota Simmons have such a high level of dedication at his age?&nbsp;And as if&nbsp;debuting&nbsp;on live television as a tween wasn't enough,&nbsp;being <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">praised by an actual&nbsp;NBA Hall of Famer, in Dominique Wilkins</a>,&nbsp;almost guaranteed that Simmons had an NBA future. Unfortunately,&nbsp;that scenario didn't come true. Graduating from&nbsp;<span class=school-name>New Faith Christian Academy in 2019,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Simmons&nbsp;received a national ranking of 1,784</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=never-panned-out---felipe-lopez><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Never Panned Out - Felipe Lopez</span></h2><p>There can definitely be disadvantages to receiving publicity in a big market like New York. After all, the state is often referred to as the "Mecca of basketball" for a reason. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leaving the Dominican Republic at 14</a>, Felipe Lopez learned that the hard way. Dominating media headlines, the amount of expectations Lopez endured throughout high school and St. John's became unrealistic. Struggling to adjust at the NBA level, Lopez was out of the league after 5 years.</p><h2 id=never-panned-out---michael-johnson><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Never Panned Out - Michael Johnson</span></h2><p>From an early age, Michael Johnson mastered the sport of football.&nbsp;Garnering nationwide attention over his accomplishments in the Manchester City's Academy program — an English developmental league for underage footballers — the midfielder was soon signed by the Elite Squad. However, Johnson never lived up to the potential he had previously shown.&nbsp;Battling&nbsp;injuries and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mental health issues</a>, he was last heard <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">discussing his plans to open up a restaurant</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=never-panned-out---danny-almonte><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Never Panned Out - Danny Almonte</span></h2><p>Age remained prominent throughout Danny Almonte's baseball career.&nbsp;At one point being the star pitcher that led the Bronx Baby Bombers to the 2001 Little league World Series,&nbsp;Almonte's team forfeited their wins when an investigation revealed Almonte's father had falsified his birth certificate. Later attending James Monroe High School and spending time in the independent league, after going undrafted, Almonte&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">opted to pursue a coaching career</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Athletes Who Were Infamously Caught Cheating</a></span></p><h2 id=never-panned-out---sebastian-telfair><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Never Panned Out - Sebastian Telfair</span></h2><p>When The Dallas Morning News wrote a piece on a 7th grader named Sebastian Telfair, the hype only grew from there. Telfair appeared on the cover of Slam Magazine alongside LeBron James, and after contemplating attending college to play for legendary coach Rick Pitino, Telfair instead went straight to the pros. Due to lacking a jump shot and never necessarily developing, Telfair bounced around 8 teams and was out of the NBA after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 seasons</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WWE Claims Layoffs Were Needed To Save Money, But AEW Played A Role Too</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoaGcmXqxvs6doKCxXai9sL7TrGSsrJGnwG7Dx6hkp52mmr9uvMCnpZ6cXaTCtXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
