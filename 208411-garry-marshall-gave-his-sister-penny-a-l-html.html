Since he was older than her, he reached a celebrity status before.</p><p class=dh>Fortunately, Penny was always a talented actress, and Garry knew it. For that reason, while he was working in "The Odd Couple," he brought his sister to play Myrna for two years, between 1972 and 1974. From that point on, her career skyrocketed.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>PENNY MARSHALL ON HOW HER BROTHER GAVE HER A LIFE</strong></p><p class=dh>Apart from working in "Paul Sand in Friends and Lovers," "Mary Tyler Moore," and "Happy Days," Penny starred in "Laverne & Shirley," which is one of her most memorable roles even nowadays. Back in 2016, Penny <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.etonline.com/tv/202090_exclusive_penny_marshall_opens_up_about_late_brother_garry_marshall_he_gave_me_a_life>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"My brother gave me a life. It's not many people who have a brother who give them a life. He gave me a life, and I appreciate it, and I tried to not let him down."</p><p class=dh>One of the main reasons for Penny to credit her brother for how her life turned out to be in such a way is that, before "The Odd Couple," she had been told that <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/penny-marshall-sitcom-star-who-directed-league-of-their-own-dies-at-75/2018/12/18/d81ed3ac-02f5-11e9-9122-82e98f91ee6f_story.html?utm_term=.59a2e172bb91">she was "unattractive."</a></p><p class=dh>Garry always supported her and made sure that she knew that show producers just couldn't understand her yet. "They'll learn to like you," Garry used to tell his sister.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>THEIR RELATIONSHIP TOOK A TOLL FOR "LAVERNE & SHIRLEY"</strong></p><p class=dh>Unfortunately, working together in "Laverne & Shirley" <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.npr.org/2012/04/28/151543940/garry-marshall-on-his-happy-days>negatively affected</a> the bond that the siblings had. Garry even admitted that it was the "toughest show" he ever did because the main star was his sister.</p><p class=dh>The producer and director confessed that Penny had plenty of ideas to improve the series, and while some of them indeed made it better, they also led to some creative differences between them.</p><p class=dh>Garry Marshall is known for making happy the people who worked with him. However, he "couldn't seem" to make his own sister happy while working together. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/magazine/navigating-garry-marshalls-career.html>revealed</a>:</p><p class=dh>"It was just a mess, but of course I still talk to her. I don't think you can tell your family that you can't come in the house."</p><p class=dh>Although working together in "Laverne & Shirley" was tough, they made amends reasonably quickly and kept working together for years in films like "A League of Their Own" and "Hocus Pocus."</p><p class=dh>Sadly, both stars passed away already. Garry <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2016/07/19/garry-marshall-dies-obituary/87325512/>died first</a>, on July 19, 2016, from complications of pneumonia following a stroke. <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/obituaries/penny-marshall-dead.html>Penny</a> has been with her brother in Heaven since December 17, 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/08b593a3302550037dfb6929523724f6.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Penny Marshall and Garry Marshall in Beverly Hills, California | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>TRIBUTE TO GARRY MARSHALL</strong></p><p class=dh>Earlier this year, the legendary producer <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://abc7ny.com/entertainment/the-happy-days-of-garry-marshall-abc-honors-late-star/6176004/>was honored</a> by ABC with a primetime special titled "The Happy Days of Garry Marshall."</p><p class=dh>As actress Cindy Williams (Shirley in "Laverne & Shirley") described, it featured "a lot of very upbeat, comical, wonderful people talking about an upbeat, magnificent genius of a man."</p><p class=dh>According to ABC, Garry Marshall was sure that a person could do a better job if they felt comfortable, and the audience perceives an actor's good job.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtncWxhZnqordGrsGalkafAqa3LpWSgmaaaeqm10maqoqukmr9uvMSnpbJlkWK5b7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
