Many of <a href=#>the cast members of Ted Lasso got their jobs</a> thinking they their characters would play small roles in comparison to that of Jason Sudeikis' titular character. But as the creators of the show moved past just focusing on the main character and <a href=#>the real-life story that inspired him</a>, they found that expanding their world was what would simultaneously expand the fanbase. Not only have <a href=#>the supporting cast got their net worths boosted</a> from their developed roles but fans all over the world have fallen in love with them. They haven't, however, fallen in love with every storyline.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some people adored Toheeb Jimoh's Sam's newly found romance with Hannah Waddingham's Rebecca. Others, not so much. The Washington Post even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">described the relationship between the two characters as "sour"</a>. It's one of those unexpected developments that Ted Lasso has become just so good at. But despite the divided reaction, Toheeb was utterly excited to spend so much on-screen time with Hannah...</p><h2 id=what-toheeb-jimoh-thought-about-sam-and-rebecca-getting-together-on-ted-lasso>What Toheeb Jimoh Thought About Sam And Rebecca Getting Together On Ted Lasso</h2><p>During <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with Vulture</a>, Toheeb Jimoh revealed that he had absolutely no idea that Rebecca was corresponding with his character on the fictional dating app Bantr. And he didn't know until he actually read the script that revealed the truth. Hannah Waddingham, on the other hand, absolutely knew what was going on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Say This Is The Worst ‘Ted Lasso’ Episode</a></span></p><p>"I don’t know why she didn’t tell me as well," Toheeb said to Vulture. "Yeah, of course, she did [know]. But I just called Hannah [after I read the script]. We just geeked out. It was hilarious because Hannah and I also have a very close relationship, so we were really tight anyway. I was just really excited because I was going to get to do scenes with Hannah."</p><p>"Usually, we get one or two; we had a couple in the first season. Up until episode six, when the reveal comes about, me and Hannah hadn’t really had that much to do together. So I just really wanted opportunities to work with her. And I was just really glad that we got to explore this version of Sam. In season two, he’s growing up a lot more. He’s learning to stand on his own two feet. We’re watching him grow into a man a little bit. To get to see him off the pitch and venture into a little bit of romance and try to find himself is great. It’s a lot for me to do as an actor, and I get to share that with Hannah."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-sam-and-rebecca-39-s-age-difference-get-in-the-way-and-did-they-have-an-attraction-before-matching-on-the-app>Did Sam And Rebecca's Age Difference Get In The Way And Did They Have An Attraction Before Matching On The App?</h2><p>While some fans are really uncomfortable with the age difference and power imbalance within Sam and Rebecca's relationship, Toheeb thinks it's utterly logical. Not only that, it's common and certainly shouldn't be frowned upon since they are both very much into each other. As for whether his character had an attraction to Rebecca prior to them matching on Bantr, Toheeb had this to say to Vulture.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Think This Is Jason Sudeikis' Best Scene In 'Ted Lasso'</a></span></p><p>"I think a lot about that scene we had in the first season where Sam goes into Rebecca’s office and speaks to her and tries to get her to come down to partake in the curse thing, where everybody is burning something to get rid of the curse they have on the team. I think they just immediately had a kinship. There is immediately a connection there. There is immediately a chemistry there, and they just have a bit of a soul-bond friendship thing with each other. And at the end of the day, I think they just make each other feel very comfortable, even though Sam is a bit fidgety and weird with her because she’s his boss. And he always remembers that," Toheeb explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"At the basis of their friendship, there’s a connection there that just everything else doesn’t really matter. This is just somebody who makes me feel comfortable, who is nice to you, and who you like. And of course, she’s incredibly attractive as well. Yeah, I think he would like her, but at this point you just kind of go, Oh, there’s no way that would happen. And so you leave that, and you’re more than happy to have a friendship with this person. But then once this opportunity presents itself, I feel like Sam is at a place in his life where he can just be open enough to go, You know what? The logistics don’t matter. This is somebody who I feel comfortable with, somebody who makes me happy, and somebody who I want to make happy. And I think I can do that."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Crazy Salary Bump Jason Sudeikis Got For 'Ted Lasso'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKCVmq9utsimpqFlpJ28trPHrapmp55iwKK5jKucm52TmK5uvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPZquenF2hrrS%2Fzmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
