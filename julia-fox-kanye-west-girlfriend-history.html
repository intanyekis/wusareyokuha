Then <a href=#>Ye paired up with model-influencer Vinetria</a> in November 2021.</p><p>That, too, fizzled out, and fans thought Ye might be recharging his campaign for Kim to take him back. He bought a house next door to his soon-to-be ex, continued to publicly ask her to reconcile... and then began dating someone new.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kim Kardashian Thinks Kanye West's Trying To Make Her Jealous, He Calls Other Women A "Distraction"</a></span></p><p>Now that Ye has gone very public with his romance with Julia Fox, everyone wants to know who she was before her new beau brought her even further into the spotlight.</p><h2 id=who-is-julia-fox>Who Is Julia Fox?</h2><p>The short answer is that Julia Fox is an actress. Fox became widely known in the acting world after her debut in Uncut Gems; before that, she'd had only one previous credit to her acting resume.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About 'Uncut Gems' Star Julia Fox's Past</a></span></p><p>Yet Fox's background is nothing to scoff at. Before acting, she modeled, embraced activism and art, and published a couple of books. She also modeled in a photoshoot with Pete Davidson.</p><p>Of all those accomplishments, her art is probably the most interesting piece for Ye fans to hear about, though.</p><p>Once, Fox hosted an art exhibition that showcased silk canvases painted with Julia's blood, which she removed via needle and syringe then simply 'painted' with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That's not all that's in Julia's past, however. Before becoming an actress, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox was actually a dominatrix and late sold her underwear for cash</a>. Knowing these details about her background, perhaps it's not so surprising that Julia and Ye hit it off the moment they met.</p><h2 id=who-is-julia-fox-39-s-ex>Who Is Julia Fox's Ex?</h2><p>Not long ago, Julia Fox was seemingly happily married to Peter Artemiev; the two were divorced in September of 2020. They share a son, who was born in early 2021.</p><p>This means Julia Fox is only recently back on the dating scene, and with a toddler, no less. But she's truly going it alone, if her social media is any indication.</p><p>Fox has lamented that her ex doesn't seem to want to be a dad and that he would rather party than spend time with his son. Julia even called him a deadbeat in a post on Instagram.</p><p>She elaborated that Peter "left" her with a house, bills, and their child. What's interesting is that 'officially,' per Wikipedia, they split in 2020. But in June 2021, the two were photographed at an event together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's possible that more happened after their split that contributed to Julia's distaste for her ex. But the two seemingly got along well enough to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">partake in their son's birthday festivities together in January 2022</a>.</p><p>But when Julia met Kanye, the timing might've been perfect for a rebound romance — or perhaps something more serious.</p><h2 id=how-did-julia-meet-ye>How Did Julia Meet Ye?</h2><p>Though their public appearances suggest a far more cemented relationship, Kanye and Julia only meet on New Year's Eve 2021 in Miami, Florida. Shortly after, <a href=#>West and Fox flew to New York for their second date</a>.</p><p>But by that time, they seemed super serious — serious enough that Julia penned a piece for Interview magazine about their whirlwind romance and how much fun they've had together.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Julia Fox Frolics On Miami Beach Following High Profile Date With Kanye West</a></span></p><p>She wrote that they danced all night and Kanye entertained her and her friends the whole time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No specific details were given on what happened when the ball dropped, but given that Fox stated she and Kanye had an instant connection, fans can presume a few things...</p><h2 id=are-julia-fox-and-kanye-serious>Are Julia Fox And Kanye Serious?</h2><p>While Julia Fox herself noted that she doesn't know where their relationship will go, she's clearly looking forward to spending more time with Ye.</p><p>Yet not everyone is convinced the two are going to last, or that there's really any affection between them at all. In fact, The Daily Beast<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">calls their entire "relationship" a PR stunt</a> and cautions fans against falling for the story.</p><p>One reason why The Daily Beast suggests taking caution with shipping these two? The fact that Kanye has hired a photographer for all of their public appearances so far.</p><p>It also seems a smidge shady that Julia penned a piece about their relationship... Less than a week after they met.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But there's also another indication that things aren't what they seem; The Daily Beast suggests that Kanye is trying to divert attention from his election "meddling," and a new semi-high-profile girlfriend seemed just the ticket.</p><p>Fans are skeptical, too, even though Julia wrote, "Everything with us has been so organic." Yet she also stated, "I don’t know where things are headed but if this is any indication of the future I’m loving the ride."</p><p>That part, at least, seems authentic. But only time will tell whether these two are truly smitten, whether Ye is using yet another GF to try and make Kim jealous, or if Julia may have something up her sleeve in the way of performance relationship art...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kanye West's New Girlfriend Julia Fox Reveals He Bought Her Hotel Suite Of Clothes</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihrqSZlnqnu9dmopqmqZp6uLHSrWSgoaKhs7O1xKebZqCZqMGwvtho</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
