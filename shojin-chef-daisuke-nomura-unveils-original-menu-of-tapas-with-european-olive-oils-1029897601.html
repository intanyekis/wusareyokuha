The croquette has a whole olive inside which, when cooked, releases the perfect amount of salty flavor into the mouth, complementing the flavor of Domyoji dough fried in olive oil.</p><p>The Mediterranean diet and <i>washoku </i>were inscribed by UNESCO as intangible cultural heritage in <span class=xn-chron>November 2010</span> and <span class=xn-chron>December 2013</span>, respectively. Mediterranean cuisine has been widely acclaimed for being served at a table where diners talk and have an enjoyable, relaxing time while eating. <i>Washoku</i>, meanwhile, was inscribed for being a traditional social custom that has been passed down over generations. The Mediterranean diet is characterized by plentiful portions of whole grains and cereals, seasonal fruits and vegetables, beans, and nuts. Rather than meat, fish is a customarily consumed dish. The food also contains plenty of olive oil and involves little consumption of the saturated fatty acids that lead to the obesity and lifestyle diseases associated with a heavy intake of meat-based oils.</p><p>Commenting on his new corroboration menu, Nomura said, "I inspired by tapas that I ate in bars in <span class=xn-location>Spain</span>, which were all beautiful and vivid in the eyes, and incorporated the idea into my <i>shojin</i> dishes. I'm particularly attracted to Spanish olive oil's ability to add flavor. Enjoy adding to and replacing flavors using olive oil at home to discover new ways to pair olive oil with your daily Japanese dishes. You will be surprised how easy it is to create really delicious fusion dishes."</p><p>Nomura's recipes will be presented at the Olive Oil World Tour's official campaign site.</p><p>Photo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1387176/Olive_Oils_from_Spain_Shojin.jpg</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae4psDSZ5muq5mjsrS%2FyKeqopyVp3uku8xopZ6vo2TAtbvCpKpoq5ikt6q6jJyfnp5dma6qv9SknGamn6LCs62MrqWvnZmhwG670aKeoqaRoXqusc2uZKieXamusa3SZq6irJhisra%2BzqmcmqZdpLmqwsRmpqKko2J%2BcX6YcXBwbmBm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
