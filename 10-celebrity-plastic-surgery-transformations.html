To go under the knife for cosmetic reasons and have it go awry must be cause for stress beyond belief and the mental anguish for many is just unbearable. Those who can afford it will add to their issues by attempting to fix a botched operation with additional surgery. Thus, for many celebrities with the funds to and the affinity for physical “tweaking” the antidote to a bad plastic surgery is usually more of the same. Though some succeed, unfortunately too many of them end up looking almost like caricatures of themselves or worse like a whole other person. Many end up with a bloated unnatural glow. Some celebrities have confirmed their procedures and some have not. Perhaps they all should have just left well enough alone; perhaps they all wish that they had. . Let’s take a look at the plastic surgery transformations of ten celebrities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-jennifer-grey><strong>10. Jennifer Grey</strong></h2><p>Actress <a title="Jennifer Grey Net Worth" href=#>Jennifer Grey</a> admits to going under the knife and drastically transforming her look from her “Dirty Dancing” days and has expressed regret about her nose job, which she believes ruined her career. The first surgery was so mishandled, that she required an additional or second surgery on her nose. The result of this was her face was so changed that even her close friends did not recognize her. Says Grey: “I went into the operating room a celebrity and came out anonymous. It was the nose job from hell. I’ll always be this once-famous actress nobody recognizes because of a nose job.”</p><p></p><h2 id=9-barry-manilow><strong>9. Barry Manilow</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>70 year old <a title="Barry Manilow Net Worth" href=#>Barry Manilow</a> is said to have undergone numerous plastic surgery procedures beginning in 1995 and including three facelifts, eyelid surgery, a brow lift and the use of steroids and Botox injections. It is also likely he has had fillers or fat transfer to the cheeks to plump up his complexion and fill out deep facial wrinkles, creases and furrows. Plastic surgery for some is a release and they can get easily addicted. At first Manilow tried to hide the fact that he was having plastic surgeries but in vain as it became more and more obvious. The entertainer has a very unnatural look.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-lil-kim><strong>8. Lil Kim</strong></h2><p>Though&nbsp;<a title="Lil’ Kim Net Worth" href=#><i>Lil’ Kim</i></a>&nbsp;is no stranger&nbsp;to cosmetic surgery&nbsp;it appears she has gone even further under the knife.&nbsp;The 90s rapper (who was known for her style and trademark facial mole) is almost unrecognizable when compared to her former self in photos. Rumor has it that she&nbsp;had a brow lift from top to bottom, lip reduction, a nostril reduction,&nbsp;cheek augmentation and a possible chin implant. But people are talking about the radical changes in her looks.&nbsp;<i>Lil’ Kim’s</i>&nbsp;smile is sort of lopsided which may mean her lower left lip may not be working correctly, due to some sort of muscle or nerve weakness as a result of all the cosmetic work she’s supposedly had. The rapper and her camp vehemently deny she has had any further work done, but the pictures seem to tell another story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-bruce-jenner><strong>7. Bruce Jenner</strong></h2><p>Former Olympian 64 year old <a title="Bruce Jenner Net Worth" href=#>Bruce Jenner</a> has been very open about his many cosmetic surgeries, beginning with a partial face-lift and nose job in the mid-'80s, a "botched" procedure that took a toll on the athlete's self-esteem. Jenner went under the knife for a second time to correct the first operation. Despite his family's approval, Jenner faced plenty of media scrutiny for his changing appearance, even feuding with Jimmy Fallon over the talk-show host's harsh jokes about his transformation. Now Jenner is sporting a new look, one that's raising eyebrows once again. He has been growing his hair long, manicuring his nails, and, most controversially, he has allegedly undergone a tracheal shave, flattening his Adam's apple. Sources close to Jenner categorically deny that he is making any sort of efforts to transition into a woman, despite the tabloid claims, and say the reality star is simply experimenting with a fresh look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-scott-carrot-top-thompson><strong>6. Scott "Carrot Top" Thompson</strong></h2><p>Red-haired comedian Scott "<a title="Carrot Top Net Worth" href=#>Carrot Top</a>" Thompson is no stranger to being included in lists of horrifying plastic surgeries. But the comedian denies having work: "People think I've had plastic surgery -- no, it just takes a lot of makeup to make me look good." It appears as though Thompson has undergone an eyebrow lift, along with Botox injections, lip plumping and laser peels, which might be evident, due to his sudden lack of freckles. It has also been speculated that he uses steroids due to his suddenly muscular and veiny physique.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-donatella-versace><strong>5. Donatella Versace</strong></h2><p>The 54 year old Vice President of the high-fashionVersace brand has apparently gone through a series of surgeries since the 1990s. Among other adjustments her most noticeable changes have been to her nose and lips. In fact her trademark swollen mouth has scored her a spot on nearly every list of plastic surgeries gone bad. Of course, there is no published evidence that <a title="Donatella Versace Net Worth" href=#>Versace</a> herself is unhappy with her results. The designer admits only getting Botox, and recently attributed her “youthful look” to an extensive beauty regiment. “I’m not like this genetically. I use tons of cream and take care of my hair and skin.” she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-suzanne-somers><strong>4. Suzanne Somers</strong></h2><p>Has 64 year old actress <a title="Suzanne Somers Net Worth" href=#>Suzanne Somers</a> had cosmetic surgery? She denies getting any work done, but is suspected of having her cheeks plumped up, a nose job, a facelift, a brow lift as well as lip injections. Somers still receives her share of attention for her amazingly youthful, though perhaps a little too tight, countenance. Unlike other celebrities who are more forthcoming about having had work done, Somers will not confirm it. So those trying to find the signs of the actress’ possible plastic surgery are left with a magnifying glass and all the before and after shots of Somers they can find. to search for clues. And there are some clues to be seen. For instance the shape of Somer’s nose has changed over the years, her face is smooth though a little tight, and her lips appear to have lost some of the firm definition that they had in her younger years. None of this is proof that Somers was on the receiving end of bad plastic surgery, but there is still swirling debate on the issue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=3-mickey-rourke><strong></strong><strong>3. Mickey Rourke</strong></h2><p>Actor <a title="Mickey Rourke Net Worth" href=#>Mickey Rourke</a> was a professional boxer and he once was a good looking man. Anyone who’s seen a boxing match knows they aren’t pretty and can do major damage to those who get in the ring. Rourke had his nose broken several times, and his cheekbone was fractured. In order to clean up the mess boxing made of his face, Rourke said, he had to get plastic surgery. But he also admits that he went to the “wrong guy” to get the reconstruction done. Since then there have been more surgeries to correct the first one. The actor needed to get his cheekbone and his nose fixed, since the scar tissue from the injuries wasn’t healing correctly.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-joan-rivers><strong>2. Joan Rivers</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A constantly transforming visage, comedienne <a title="Joan Rivers Net Worth" href=#>Joan Rivers</a> is the ultimate plastic surgery addict. Rivers has gone under the knife so often that she's barely recognizable as her former self. She makes no secret of the fact that she has had a great deal of work and doesn’t hesitate to talk about it, often as the butt of her own jokes. In an interview, Rivers revealed that she’s undergone two face-lifts, received liposuction on her thighs, and got her lips plumped every six months. “I’ve had so much plastic surgery, when I die they will donate my body to Tupperware,” she joked.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-jocelyn-wildenstein><strong>1. Jocelyn Wildenstein</strong></h2><p>You may not have heard of&nbsp;New York socialite&nbsp;<a title="Jocelyn Wildenstein Net Worth" href=#>Jocelyn Wildenstein</a>,&nbsp;who married into a wealthy art-dealing family.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, any list of plastic surgery transformations really must include her picture, as witnessed here. She began experimenting with plastic surgery in 1997, shortly before the end of her 20-year marriage. The feline features were done in part to please her husband,&nbsp;Alec Wildenstein&nbsp;who loved big cats.&nbsp;Wildenstein&nbsp;is reported to have spent $4 million on various procedures, which are speculated to include cheek implants and numerous facelifts. Her dramatic changes have earned her the nickname "Bride of Wildenstein," along with, "cat woman," due to her rather tight and feline-like facial appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the unusual appearance of the plastic surgeries, Ms. Wildenstein&nbsp;is reported to be "ecstatic with her work. She feels beautiful. She looks in the mirror and she loves what she sees. She got exactly what she wanted."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2Ysq2xwaugrbFdpbmiv9Oimmarpae0pr7YZqurmZ6os7C%2BzJqroqeeqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
