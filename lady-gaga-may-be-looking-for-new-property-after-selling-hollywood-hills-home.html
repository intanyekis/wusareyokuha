News</a> notes. Zappa’s family maintained the property until selling it to Gaga more than two decades after his passing.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Alec Baldwin Sued For Unsafe Work Conditions After A Fatal Shooting Accident On The Sets Of 'Rust'</a></span></p><p><a href=#>Architectural Digest</a> reports that it’s unknown if Gaga did any renovations to the Tudor-style home and to what extent.</p><p>Shortly after buying the place, the singer told Howard Stern she had plans to upgrade it while staying true to its original character, saying she wants to “restore it […] and also kind of leave it the way it is.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The home surely has plenty of room to renovate and decorate, as it features more than 6,5000 square feet of living space, including seven bedrooms and six bathrooms. Its other features include a standalone greenhouse, rooftop <a href=#>tennis court</a>, a swimming pool, two detached guesthouses, and a staff apartment.</p><p>It also features plenty of eclectic design elements that were incorporated by Zappa himself, including busy floral wallpaper, a steam punk staircase, and driftwood railings. It even has a fully functional <a href=#>recording studio</a> in the basement, where Gaga has recorded some of her more recent hits, including for her album Chromatica.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s unclear&nbsp; if Gaga is on the market for another home now that she’s offloaded the Hollywood Hills property. She's certainly demonstrated a knack (and passion) for home rennovations, so she may be hoping to take on a new project. For the time being, Gaga still has several California mansions to her name, including her primary residence in Malibu, which she purchased in 2014 for $23 million.</p><p>The home sits on several actress and features a horse barn, outdoor pool, and a stunning view of the Pacific Ocean. Gaga previously called the <a href=#>Malibu</a> estate her “sanctuary,” explaining, “[It’s] my oasis of peace. I call it my ‘gypsy palace.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All of Gaga’s homes are in California with the exception of an apartment she previously rented in New York City, <a href=#>New York Post</a> reports. Located in Chelsea, the singer rented the unassuming apartment for a cool $67,500 per month.</p><p>The apartment was recently completed in 2016 and comes with 5 bedrooms and 12 bathrooms. It was originally listed for $36.8 million in 2016, before being reduced by almost $10 million the following year. Though the apartment was rented out while still on the market, it was finally sold to an undisclosed buyer in 2020.</p><p>Perhaps she's planning to buy property in New York next, given her fondness for the city (it's where she was born!), but only time will tell.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Justin Bieber Collaborates With Tim Hortons In A Huge Canadian Campaign</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Architectural Digest</a>, <a href=#>Yahoo!
