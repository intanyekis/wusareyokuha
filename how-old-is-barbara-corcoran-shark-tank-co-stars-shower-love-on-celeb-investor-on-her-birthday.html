For those who don't know, Barbara is regarded as one of the original sharks on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC reality TV program</a> 'Shark Tank', which has a business motive. The Corcoran Group, a real estate agency in New York City, was founded by the entrepreneur. In 2001, she agreed to a $66 million sale of her business to the National Realty Trust (NRT).</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>What is Barbara Corcoran's net worth?

The celebrity investor turned 74 on Friday, and Daymond John and Robert Herjavec lavished her with affection on social media.</p><p>Daymond took to Twitter to pen down a beautiful note for his fellow co-star and friend, "I wanted to take a quick moment to wish my dear friend and fellow Shark, @BarbaraCorcoran, a very happy birthday! Barbara, you are an inspiration to so many people, myself included. I hope your special day is filled with joy, love, and lots of champagne!" While tagging Barbara in a tweet, Shark Robert wrote, "Happy birthday to the incredible @BarbaraCorcoran- to know you is to love you ! Grateful I get to call you my colleague and friend."</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I wanted to take a quick moment to wish my dear friend and fellow Shark, <a href=#>@BarbaraCorcoran</a>, a very happy birthday!<br>Barbara, you are an inspiration to so many people, myself included.<br>I hope your special day is filled with joy, love, and lots of champagne! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/wnjnd7PFfn</a></p>— Daymond John (@TheSharkDaymond) <a href=#>March 10, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>How did Barbara Corcoran land her role in 'Shark Tank'?</h2><p>The story of Barbara Corcoran is evidence that if at first, you don't achieve, try again. The real estate tycoon and TV celebrity started her job on 'Shark Tank' nearly 14 years ago, where she and the other panel moderators "give people from all walks of life the chance to chase the American dream and potentially secure business deals that could make them millionaires," according to ABC.</p><p>Barbara almost didn't get the chance, despite becoming one of the show's most recognized faces. Barbara claimed in an old Instagram post that the show "changed their mind" and considered another woman for the role after she was invited to join the business-themed series. "How I turned a ‘no’ into a ‘yes’! I was almost on my way to Hollywood to film the first season of Shark Tank 12 years ago when I was told the show had changed their mind," Barbara wrote in the post's caption.</p><p>Barbara penned a long letter to "the big boss" after she refused to accept no as a response, which helped her get a place on 'Shark Tank'. Barbara said, "I'm smiling bright today about the letter I wrote to the big boss that turned my fortune around and the 12 wonderful years I’ve spent helping entrepreneurs make their dreams come true on Shark Tank."</p><p>"I understand you've asked another girl to dance instead of me," the note to a man named "Mark" (presumably executive producer Mark Burnett) started. "Although I appreciate being reserved as a fall-back, I'm much more accustomed to coming in first."</p><p>She continued by outlining three justifications for him "consider inviting" her and the other ladies "to L.A. for your try outs." "I do my best when my back's against the wall. I love the heat of the competition as I've learned it brings out my best. I've had all my big successes on the heels of rejection and frankly, it's right up my alley. There was Sister Stella Marie in 5th grade who said I'd always be stupid just because I couldn't read. Then there was the New York old boy network trying to lock me out of their real estate fortunes, until I became their largest competitor," she wrote.</p><p>"There there was The Donald himself who wrongly swore in court I'd never see a penny of the $4 [million] commission he owed me for saving his ass and making the largest land deal in the city's history," she added. "And of course there was my ex-partner Ramone Simone who parted with the words, 'You know you'll never succeed without me!' I consider your rejection a lucky charm."</p><p>Secondly, Barbara continued, "If you have both ladies in LA, you can mix it up a bit and see which personalities make the best combination for your show. I've found in building teams myself that the combination of personalities is always more important than the expertise or strengths of single individuals. You may even drop a man for me because, believe it or not, I'm just as smart and mean as the next guy."</p><p>She claimed that she had "known from the get-go the shark role is a perfect fit for me" in her third and final argument. "Everything I've done so far in business and TV worlds has made me ready. My style is different than the other sharks' and your audience would fall in love with me. I've watched thirty-seven dragon episodes so far and know I could rival the best shark on each show in shrewdness and personality. It seems to me that the same two sharks steal most of the shows and I know I'd be one of them," she explained.</p><p>She praised Mark, saying, "The reputation you have in your field is equal to the reputation I have in mine," and adding that she had already scheduled a flight for her interview in Los Angeles. She then ended by thanking him.</p><p>"I know you're the best at what you do and I trust you'll reach the right decision," said Barbara. "I've booked my flight for the 6th and hope to be on that plane." Naturally, her letter was successful, and Barbara has since appeared on the program since its premiere in 2009.</p><p>'Shark Tank' airs every Friday on ABC at 8 pm ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRooJ%2BserC4w2agrGWSlr%2BjrdGaZJynopi8s63NZqqhmaKgerWtzaRknKddqMGivtJmqqGnp5q%2FbrjOr5xmp55isKa4xJtkoqammsC1u9FmpqdlmJq%2Fbq7Iq6uhnJGu</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
