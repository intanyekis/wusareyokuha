Big Sean and Jhene were head over heels in love with one another - so much so that they even put out a joint album, "Twenty88", that very same year. If fans still weren't convinced that their relationship was the real deal, Aiko got a portrait of Sean tattooed on her arm. Her ink showed just how serious she was about the Detroit native.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Well, fast forward to 2018, when these two decided to call it quits. The only thing fans could think about was how painful it would be for Jhene to have her tattoo of Sean removed. It probably didn't hurt too much in the end, as she decided to cover it instead. She chose to get a dragon tattoo on top. The couple spent a year apart before rumors circulated that they had reconciled, and these rumors were later confirmed to be true.</p><p>So, what else do we know about Big Sean and his relationship with Jhene Aiko? Here's the lowdown...</p><h2 id=they-ve-shared-an-on-off-relationship-for-years><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>They’ve Shared An On-Off Relationship For Years</span></h2><p>Big Sean and Jhene Aiko first started seeing one another in 2016, as previously mentioned. Photographs of the couple were already surfacing online at the time, but neither one of them would confirm the relationship rumors. They held off until the release of their joint album.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-released-a-joint-album-called-twenty88><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>They Released A Joint Album Called TWENTY88</span></h2><p>In April 2016, months after&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Sean's split from Ariana Grande</a>, Big Sean and Jhene dropped their debut (and only) joint studio album, "Twenty88". The record, released under their stage name, 'Twenty88', only featured eight songs and only produced one single, "Selfish". Still, the album received rave reviews, with HipHopDX rating it four out of five stars.</p><h2 id=they-ve-collaborated-on-each-other-s-songs><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>They’ve Collaborated On Each Other’s Songs</span></h2><p>Aside from their joint project, Big Sean and Jhene Aiko are frequent collaborators on their songs. Together, the two have paired up on a handful of tracks, including "I Know", "Memories", "Beware", and "None of Your Concern". Clearly, these two have a great relationship in a professional sense.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Timeline Of The Good And The Bad From Drake’s Career, In 20 Pictures</a></span></p><h2 id=they-reconciled-after-sean-gushed-about-his-love-for-jhene><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>They Reconciled After Sean Gushed About His Love For Jhene</span></h2><p>In November 2019, Big Sean admitted in his song, "None Of Your Concern", that he still had feelings for his then-ex-girlfriend...and that he was determined to win her back. “You know there’s not a day in these modern times, you haven’t crossed my mind,” he says in the song. “We both cross the line, seems like I needed you more than I needed myself.” Just weeks later, Sean and Jhene were seen out in public together, fueling rumors that they had reconciled.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-somewhat-dissed-him-in-her-song-triggered><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>She Somewhat Dissed Him In Her Song, ‘Triggered’</span></h2><p>Jhene kept her fans talking when she released, "Triggered", from her latest album, "Chilombo". On the song, she unpacked <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her anger towards an ex</a>, who many assumed was her on-off boyfriend, Big Sean. The song was recorded during the time they broke up, but when he heard the song, Jhene said: “He was just like, ‘Wow, I’m not your friend.’ I was like, ‘Well, I was feeling that in the moment. This is just a song. This is not 100 percent about you.’”</p><h2 id=she-wants-sean-to-pop-the-question><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>She Wants Sean To Pop The Question</span></h2><p>In April 2020, Sean revealed that a marriage proposal to Jhene Aiko was definitely coming. During an Instagram Live session with his girlfriend, Sean complimented Aiko's looks, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to which Jhene Aiko responded</a>: “Oh yeah? Why don’t you marry me?”Sean replied, saying: “It’s in the works.” So, expect an engagement announcement from the couple soon...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-got-a-tattoo-of-him-on-her-arm><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She Got A Tattoo Of Him On Her Arm…</span></h2><p>Jhene left a lot of people stunned when she got a large tattoo of Big Sean’s face on her arm. While it’s certainly a nice tattoo, fans were worried about what the mother-of-one would do with the tat if she called it quits with the rapper. The two already had a history of breaking up, so people certainly weren’t too happy about Jhene’s decision to tattoo Sean’s face on her body.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">18 Photos Of The Most Stunning Women The Weeknd Has Been Spotted With</a></span></p><h2 id=but-later-covered-it-up-when-they-split><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>… But Later Covered It Up When They Split</span></h2><p>And, as feared, Jhene ended up splitting with Sean - this time, it seemed as if the couple had gone their separate ways for good. In 2018, they called it quits, and while the reason why was never revealed, it was serious enough for Jhene to hide her tattoo of Sean, by covering it up with a dragon tattoo.</p><h2 id=they-ve-often-talked-about-their-intimate-moments-together><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>They’ve Often Talked About Their Intimate Moments Together</span></h2><p>Big Sean has never been shy about discussing his intimate moments with Jhene - he wants the world to know about these things. On their song, "None Of Your Concern", the Detroit hitmaker described just how freaky things can get in the bedroom. Let’s just say these two are certainly made for each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=big-sean-frequently-posts-jhene-on-social-media><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Big Sean Frequently Posts Jhene On Social Media</span></h2><p>They’ve shared an on-off relationship for the past four years, but it seems like Big Sean is still head over heels in love with the songstress, who is frequently plastered all over his social media platforms. He’ll always add a thought-provoking caption while posting a beautiful snap of his woman. How endearing!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariana Grande And Big Sean: Forgotten Facts About Their Past Relationship</a></span></p><h2 id=they-visited-disneyland-on-valentine-s-day><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>They Visited Disneyland On Valentine's Day</span></h2><p>For Valentine’s Day in February 2020, Jhene Aiko and Big Sean decided to celebrate the occasion at Disneyland.

In February 2020, Sean sat down for an interview with Joe, where he went on to discuss his girlfriend’s influence on modern R&B.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I feel like with R&B music she really helped drive that sound. She's one of the pioneers of that style of R&B," he said. "When I'm with her I see the respect that her peers give her.</p><p>Joe then chimed in and said, "I wish she would unblock me," to which Sean hit back, “You shouldn’t have been talking all that sh** then."</p><h2 id=they-deem-each-other-soulmates><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>They Deem Each Other Soulmates</span></h2><p>They’ve been together for four years, and though there have been plenty of ups and downs in their relationship, it looks as if Big Sean and Jhene are finally ready to settle down with one another.
