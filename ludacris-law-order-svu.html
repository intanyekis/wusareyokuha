Keep reading to <a href=# rel=noopener>see if Ludacris will return to Law & Order: SVU as Darius Parker</a>.</p><p>Created by Dick Wolf, <a href=# rel=noopener>Law & Order: SVU</a>&nbsp;is the first spin-off of&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Law & Order</a>&nbsp;and the second in the&nbsp;Law & Order&nbsp;franchise. It first premiered in 1999 and follows trained detectives in the New York City Police Department as they investigate sexually related crimes. Rapper-turned-actor Ice-T has starred on the show for nearly as long as Mariska Hargitay, having joined the cast during Season 2 as Detective&nbsp;Odafin “Fin” Tutuola.</p><p>Countless celebrities have appeared on SVU alongside Hargitay, Ice-T and the rest of the cast. From Academy Award-winning actors like Robin Williams to athletes such as Serena Williams and Mike Tyson, nearly every big player in Hollywood has guest starred on SVU at some point. If Ice-T had to choose just one guest star to make another cameo, though, he’d like to see rapper Ludacris return to the show, as he told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">NBC Insider</a> during a January 2024 interview.</p><p>Ice-T had previously shared how much he enjoyed working with the “My Chick Bad” artist while speaking to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Billboard</a> earlier this month. “I had a good time with him,” he shared of Ludacris’ time on the show. “He actually got to play through his own day in court; he defended himself, which was kind of cool.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ludacris-SVU.jpg alt="Ludacris, SVU" width=982 height=573 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Ludacris first guest starred on SVU&nbsp;in Season 7. He played Darius Parker, Fin’s relative. After being put on trial for the murder of a woman and her baby, Darius finds out that he himself is the product of incestuous rape; Darius’ mother Theresa (Fin’s ex-wife) was raped by her own father when she was just 16 years old. Ludacris reprised his role in the Season 8 episode “Screwed,” where he goes to trial for his crime and defends himself. Darius manages to get his confession thrown out and he is found not guilty, but Fin disowns him for what he did.</p><p>Like Ice-T, Ludacris got his start as a hip-hop artist and rapper. The Grammy-winning singer landed his first acting role in the 2003 film 2 Fast 2 Furious and has continued to star in the Fast and The Furious franchise ever since. He has starred in the movies Fred Claus, No Strings Attached, John Henry and Dashing Through the Snow.</p><p>Ice-T, for his part, rose to fame in ’80s thanks to hit rap songs like “6 in the Mornin,” “Ya Don’t Quit,” and “I’m Your Pusher.” In 1990, he founded the heavy metal band Body Count, which is still active today. The rapper began to pursue an acting career in the early ’90s, starring in the films <i>New Jack City, Trespass&nbsp;</i>and Who’s The Man?&nbsp;&nbsp;After starring on the Dick Wolf-created show New York Undercover, he nabbed his role on SVU and began to really establish himself as an actor.</p><p>“The one thing about [creator] Dick Wolf [and production company Wolf Entertainment] is they understand how musicians translate into acting — they have no fear of that,” he told Billboard. “I think Dick Wolf’s theory is, ‘If you could be a star at something, you could be a star at anything.’”</p><p>Fans would certainly want to see the two musicians share the screen again, and with the way Ludacris’ story arc ended, we can easily see Darius popping back up in Fin’s life.</p><p>Law & Order: SVU airs on NBC on Thursdays at 9 pm EST and streams on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Peacock</a>.</p><p><strong>For more on Law & Order: SVU, check out this gallery on t<a href=# rel=noopener>he most memorable guest stars</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvYWuBcoGOpaydmZOntrR5y5quZqeimbKzedKvrGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
