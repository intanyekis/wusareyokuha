The judge cited that with no wife to go home to and little to lose, Masterson now has every incentive to escape and little reason to return to prison if his conviction is upheld on appeal.   Bijou Phillips initially defended Masterson in court but later filed for divorce, surprising many given her previous support of him despite the allegations he faced."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I always felt that she would be OK because Danny is an amazing father,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she wrote in a letter to the court requesting leniency</a>. “He was devoted to our daughter, would read her books, take her on walks and to ballet lessons. I never once heard him complain. The two were inseparable.”</p><p>Other celebs like <a href=#>Mila Kunis</a> and <a href=#>Ashton Kutcher</a> wrote similar letters supporting Masterson before the convicted, though they received public backlash when the news came to light.</p><p>Danny and Bijou have been married since 2011. They welcomed their daughter, Fianna Francis Masterson, in 2014. However, in 2017, multiple women accused Masterson of rape, allegations that he vehemently denied. The accusations led to his firing from the Netflix series The Ranch, subsequent legal proceedings, and now his current incarceration.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmqaernqurdKtnKurn6PAbq3PqZyapF2Zsq%2B1xJ1knKelp8FurcKcrKydo2LEorrToqWgZZahsqZ51qKdnmWUnsOwvsKeZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
