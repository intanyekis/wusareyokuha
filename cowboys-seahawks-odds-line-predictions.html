Coming into the game, the Cowboys are comfortably in the playoffs, but the <a href=#>Seahawks</a> are fighting for their playoff lives. Seattle has won four straight matchups with Dallas. Dallas is a big favorite.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Kickoff is set for 8:15 p.m. ET on Thursday at AT&T Stadium. The game will be televised on Amazon Prime.</p><p>The <a href=#>Cowboys</a> are one of the hottest teams in the NFL and dominant on both sides of the ball. They lead the league in scoring (31.5) and give up the fourth-fewest points per game (16.8). Dak Prescott has played himself into the MVP conversation. Over the past five games, Prescott has thrown for more than 300 yards in four of five contests and has a touchdown-to-interception ratio of 17:2. He also chipped in a rushing touchdown. Tony Pollard comes into the game with touchdowns in two straight after not scoring since Week 1. He’ll look to continue his resurgence against a <a href=#>Seahawks</a> defense that’s been susceptible to the run. Seattle has given up 14 rushing touchdowns and allows an average of 117.7 rushing yards per game.</p><p><a class=ath_autolink data-id=hB8bdcsNCHE7y9Hj href=#>Geno Smith</a> failed to duplicate last season’s magic, which led to being named 2022 Comeback Player of the Year. Dallas has kept all their opponents under 20 points during their three-game winning streak. Injuries have certainly played a role in Seattle’s offensive struggles. Smith is dealing with an elbow injury, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=9cy2RC8JyNrBYaLj href=#>DK Metcalf</a> has battled through hip and rib injuries, and Kenneth Walker is battling an oblique injury. Walker missed Week 12 and his status for Week 13 is doubtful.</p><p>All <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">odds from BetMGM</a>.
