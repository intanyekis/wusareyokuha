One client said they’ve lost $1 million doing business with Piña, while another is apparently $500,000 out of pocket.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Piña, who teamed up with Envy in 2018 to host a series of seminars on the real estate business across the tri-state area, <a href=# rel=noopener>issued a statement on Instagram</a> last week denying the allegations and clarifying that the Breakfast Club co-host had no involvement in any of the deals.</p><p>“My business partner and friend DJ Envy is being brought into something he has nothing to do with,” he wrote in part. “He was never given any money to do any real estate deals with me nor has he been party to any deals, negotiations nor partnerships that I have had with investors.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>DJ Envy himself addressed the scandal in a recent Instagram Live interview with former NFL player-turned-podcaster Tony “The Closer” Robinson, who had <a href=# rel=noopener>called out Piña on Twitter</a> for allegedly having 20 properties up for foreclosure.</p><p>“I honestly don’t know that’s between them and whatever happened,” the veteran DJ/radio personality said during the conversation. “But did I say, ‘There, take this money and give it to this person or do this with this money?’ I never did.</p><p>“If you ever came to my seminar, I tell everybody, ‘Everybody on this stage, whether it’s credit, prepare, or it’s a conventional lender, do your homework because I don’t trust anybody.’ If you’ve been to my seminars, I say that a million times.”</p><p></p><p>While discussing the scandal with his co-hosts on the latest episode of The Joe Budden Podcast, Joe Budden silently opened his laptop and began playing <a href=# rel=noopener>Kanye West’s</a> “Jail,” specifically the part where he raps: “Guess who’s going to jail tonight!”</p><p>From there, Budden proceeded to lay into Cesar Piña and DJ Envy, whose <a href=# rel=noopener>recent claim</a> that Charlamagne Tha God — not Joe Budden — should’ve topped <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Complex‘s Hip Hop Media Ranking</a> appears to have gotten under the former Slaughterhouse rapper’s skin.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“My God don’t play about Joseph Anthony Budden Jr.,” Budden said. “All of that hootenanny about that Complex list… a bunch of hootenanny about absolutely nothing.”</p><p>After co-host QueenzFlip called Budden “a narcissist with a capital N” and urged him to “stand on it,” he obliged by removing his headphones and literally standing on the couch, prompting surprised laughter from his co-hosts.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/05/joe-budden-gillie-da-kid-beef-podcast-250x142.jpg alt="Joe Budden & Gillie Da Kid Trade Shots As 'Podcast Beef' Reignites" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Joe Budden & Gillie Da Kid Trade Shots As 'Podcast Beef' Reignites</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>May 8, 2023</p></a><p>“Please, you knew something was fishy,” Budden continued after taking his seat again. “That little fat n-gga ain’t been around in about a year and a half. Envy ain’t stood next to that n-gga in about 18 months. We ain’t seen a course, we ain’t seen an advertisement, a commercial — these n-ggas know when the heat is on the way. Knock it off.”</p><p>The New Jersey native then claimed that DJ Envy’s recent <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>spat with Gunplay</a> and <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>car show beef with Rick Ross</a> were merely “distractions” designed to divert attention away from Piña’s alleged misdeeds, and urged the Breakfast Club co-host to give his partner up.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“All that Gunplay shit? Distraction. All that car show shit? Distraction,” he said. “Produce that little fat fuck! Get him out of here! Where he at? You n-ggas been all around Hudson County, Essex County, every New Jersey county — get that little fuck to the front row and say, ‘Aye, Cesar — pizza, pizza — let’s get to it.’</p><p>“Look at what we talking about: a n-gga named Cesar gets to just hide! No, n-gga, don’t hide now. Come on, you was at Vest Fest, you was at every other fest, get your ass out here. Don’t get to just texting, ‘I thought that I could use my platform to inspire’ — n-gga, you even addressing this like a scammer! You don’t even know that your reply sounds scam-ish!</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“Come on, papa. Come on out. Envy, Charlamagne, I don’t need to hear none of that Gunplay shit, what else y’all got going on up there. Bring Cesar up there. I’ll tell you the guest we want to see. I’m tuning in! Enough of all that bringing the political parties, Dr. Umar — all that shit cool. Get Cesar up there, though. Can’t be too hard to find him.”</p><p>Budden concluded his rant by throwing more shade at the duo, saying: “Got the car show… you n-ggas been promising garages out here. These n-ggas been running around fucking promising two and three families. They did all of this under your nose.”</p><p>Watch the full segment below:</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mihqJ1dl8KlsMSnZJ2iXZq7t8WMq5yapF2awLWt055krJuRorqqusZmmKWklZyutbXOp6o%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
