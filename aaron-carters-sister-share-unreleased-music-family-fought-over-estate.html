The fans were just reaching out to Aaron Pearce [the album’s producer] and I, begging us to release this music.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They even played a sample of the song “Recovery,” which is also the title of the album. “Hit me like a hurricane / Caught up in your tidal wave / And now I’m back on solid ground / Tomorrow is a new day / Trying to shake the pain away / Cause I’m still in recovery,” the lyrics say, seeming to reference Aaron’s struggles with addiction.</p><p>Aaron’s sister said that part of the proceeds from the album will go to charity, specifically The Kids Mental Health Foundation. The other portion will go towards Aaron’s only child, son Prince, 2, who was only a few months old when the singer died.</p><h2 id=aaron-rsquo-s-family-disputed-his-estate-when-he-died-without-a-will>Aaron’s Family Disputed His Estate When He Died Without A Will</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Aaron-Carter.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While there seems to be no dispute who’ll make profits from Aaron’s forthcoming album, there were reports shortly after his death that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his family was arguing over his estate</a>.</p><p>"The family is fighting her, it's a mess<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">," a source told The U.S. Sun</a> in November 2022, explaining that Prince’s mother Melanie Martin was lawyering up to ensure their son inherits Aaron’s estate.

However, the musician died without a will and wasn’t married to Melanie. The pair had also lost custody of Prince due to domestic violence and substance abuse concerns, though Melanie regained custody after Aaron’s passing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By December 2022, Carter’s extended <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">family had expressed their desire for Prince</a> to be the sole benefactor of Aaron’s estate. His mother, Jane Carter, confirmed to TMZ that they weren’t challenging Prince’s right to inherit what was left of Carter’s net worth.</p><p>Jane Carter also said she hoped to have a relationship with Prince one day, suggesting she’s estranged from Melanie. Aaron had an infamously tumultuous relationship with his family, even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">making abuse allegations against his older brother and sister</a>. His brother, Nick Carter, took out a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">restraining order against Aaron</a> after the pop star made threats against Nick’s then-pregnant wife. It’s unclear if Nick is helping to release Aaron’s post-humous album, or to what degree his former fiancé Melanie Martin is involved, either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYmqqfo3qkrdGtnKurXai2tMDEq2SsoJGnsm7BzaucpZ2RqLKlecyuqqKbXZuurrXLsmSfp6WctbV5zq%2Bcq2WVqMGiwMRo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
