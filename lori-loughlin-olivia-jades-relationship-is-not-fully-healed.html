Olivia Jade Giannulli is still repairing her relationship with her parents Lori Loughlin and Mossimo Giannulli, a source tells Us Weekly exclusively.
“Lori and Olivia Jade’s relationship has not fully healed,” the insider tells Us. However, it has been getting better since the actress, 55, pleaded guilty for her part in the college admissions scandal.
In May, a second source told Us exclusively that the influencer, 20, is “really proud of her mom for pleading guilty” and it’s helped her feel a bit better knowing that her parents will “face the consequences for their actions."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

[She] knows it’s a slow rebuild and that <a href=#>she’ll have to start from the ground up</a> and be weary of her choices.”</p><p>With reporting by Brody Brown</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalp6Keeq271KCfpaGeYryttdWimGaikZmytHnRnqOarJmku7S0yKlkoqtdo7y1ecWuo6WxXZ2yorjEnWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
