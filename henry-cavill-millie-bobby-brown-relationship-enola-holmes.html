When two massive stars like Cavill and Brown film a movie together, it's only a matter of time before fans start speculating about their relationship. Specifically, in this case, their working relationship – certainly nothing romantic. Cavill is 38 years old, while Brown is just 17. So what exactly was the working relationship like between Henry Cavill and Millie Bobby Brown? Here is everything we know.</p><h2 id=millie-bobby-brown-and-henry-cavill-met-while-working-on-the-film-39-enola-holmes-39><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Millie Bobby Brown And Henry Cavill Met While Working On The Film 'Enola Holmes'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Enola Holmes stars Millie Bobby Brown in the title role. As you might have guessed, Enola is the sister of the famed fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, who is played in the film by Henry Cavill. Enola is just a teenager, but she wants to be a detective like her older brother. While Enola is the main character of this film, Sherlock still plays an important supporting role.</p><h2 id=brown-was-also-a-producer-for-39-enola-holmes-39><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Brown Was Also A Producer For 'Enola Holmes'</span></h2><p>Millie Bobby Brown had only just turned fifteen years old when production began on Enola Holmes, but <a href=#>she still served as a producer on the film</a>. <a href=#>She was a big fan of the Enola Holmes books</a> when she was growing up, and reportedly <a href=#>she played a very important role in determining the direction the film would take</a>. While we do not know how involved she was in the casting process, it's possible that she had some input in who her co-star would be. If nothing else, it's clear that Henry Cavill was chosen for his role because of his strong brotherly chemistry with Brown.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-two-actors-have-a-lot-in-common><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Two Actors Have A Lot In Common</span></h2><p>Henry Cavill and Millie Bobby Brown are both British citizens working in Hollywood. When they aren't in America, both actors are known to live in London. They both began acting when they were still kids, although Brown's career started much earlier than Cavill's – she landed her first professional acting role when she was just nine years old, while he didn't start acting until after he finished high school. Cavill and Brown have both done a significant amount of work with Netflix, but they're also familiar with blockbuster action franchises. Cavill has starred in several DCEU films as Superman, while Brown plays a lead role in Legendary Pictures' MonsterVerse. With so much in common, Millie Bobby Brown and Henry Cavill must have had plenty to bond over on the set of Enola Holmes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#> Who Are Millie Bobby Brown's Older Siblings, And What Do They Do?</a></span></p><h2 id=henry-cavill-is-a-big-fan-of-millie-bobby-brown-39-s-work><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Henry Cavill Is A Big Fan Of Millie Bobby Brown's Work</span></h2><p>While he was promoting Enola Holmes, <a href=#>Henry Cavill revealed in an interview that one of the reasons he decided to act in the film was because of Millie Bobby Brown's involvement</a>. He said that he was not initially interested in playing Sherlock Holmes, but after he read the script and learned "that Millie Bobby Brown was attached," joining the cast of the film was "a very easy decision" to make. He went on to say "I am a fan of Millie Bobby Brown's, I think she's extraordinary." Not only was he a big fan of Brown's beforehand, but Cavill has since made it clear that <a href=#>he was a big fan of her acting performance in </a><a href=#>Enola Holmes</a> too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Drake's Relationship With Millie Bobby Brown</a></span></p><h2 id=there-is-no-bad-blood-between-millie-bobby-brown-and-henry-cavill><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>There Is No Bad Blood Between Millie Bobby Brown And Henry Cavill</span></h2><p><a href=#>There have been some rumors that Brown and Cavill do not get along</a>, but these rumors are entirely unsubstantiated. <a href=#>In an interview with Good Morning America, Brown suggested</a> that she was sometimes jealous of Cavill's professionalism on set and his ability to stop laughing and prepare for the next take, but that hardly amounts to any bad blood. Meanwhile, <a href=#>Cavill has gushed about his time on set with Brown</a>, saying "Millie's a lot like a sister, she is a lot of fun. We had a lot of laughs together."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-seem-to-get-along-with-one-another-quite-well><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>They Seem To Get Along With One Another Quite Well</span></h2><p>While they were promoting Enola Holmes, Millie Bobby Brown and Henry Cavill did several interviews together. From the way they interact with one another in these interviews, it certainly seems like they get along quite well. <a href=#>In one clip they play a game called the "Zoomed-In Challenge" together</a> and seem to have a great time. <a href=#>Fans have sometimes accused Henry Cavill of being "painfully awkward"</a> during interviews, but he still always appears to get along with his co-stars.</p><h2 id=they-are-set-to-begin-filming-the-39-enola-holmes-39-sequel-this-fall><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>They Are Set To Begin Filming the 'Enola Holmes' Sequel This Fall</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>'Enola Holmes' received rave reviews from film critics, and so <a href=#>production is already underway for a sequel</a>. Brown will obviously be returning to the title role, and Henry Cavill will be reprising his role as well. The fact that both actors have decided to return for a sequel certainly suggests that they enjoyed working with one another the first time around. Perhaps if the sequel fares well, Brown and Cavill could collaborate on a third Enola Holmes film as well.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here's Why Fans Are Glad Henry Cavill Didn't Become The Next James Bond</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhkoZ2ep8Zur8CvoKWkXaK2rbjInmSbp5KXxm6u0aiup2WimrmiwMiopaygmaV6prrOpZhmoJ%2Bhuqa%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
