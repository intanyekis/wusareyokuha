Today she is selling out stadiums, people declaring the star an incredible performer and truly defining "Future Nostalgia".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>FKA Twigs, 34, is an English singer who started her career back when she was 17 as a dancer. She made her musical debut back in 2012 with "EP1". The electro-R&B singer just released a new mixtape, "Caprisongs".</p><p>Now, the man in the middle of it all, Arón Piper. Piper, 25, is best known for his role as the lovable Ander Munoz on the Netflix series Elite. He has been acting for almost ten years in movies that are based in his home of Madrid.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>New Rules: Dua Lipa Is Changing Pop Music, Here's How</a></span></p><h2 id=where-did-it-all-start><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Where Did It All Start?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/0d5963d0-e6f9-11ec-a7d0-09211d89623d_800_420.png><p>It all started back in June, when a TikTok was posted of Dua Lipa and Arón Piper dancing (really dancing), whispering in each other's ears and laughing from a Madrid nightclub. Not even a full day later, the very next morning, FKA Twigs posted her own TikTok.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The video displayed her and the popular actor engaged in a steamy make out session on a beach.</p><p>Did Arón leave the club and go straight to making out with another girl on the beach?

Some fans showing support for Dua right away, stating they were glad she was getting back out there. Some fans very confused about this action being very out of character for Twigs. Even though both the girls are very open about their lives and relationships, Piper is usually very private. This lead to other fans immediately speculating that it was all just a publicity ploy to promote a new single, perhaps one with Piper staring in the music video, or just completely caught in between the drama.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How FKA Twigs Really Feels About Ex-Boyfriend Robert Pattinson Today</a></span></p><h2 id=what-about-fka-twigs-boyfriend><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>What About FKA Twigs Boyfriend?<img alt="FKA Twigs & Matty Healy" height=null src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FKA-Twigs-and-Matt-Healy.avif width=null style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h2><p>Twigs and The 1975 frontman, Matty Healy, reportedly fell madly in love during the 2020 lockdown in the UK. The couple spent most of the lockdown creating music together and were seemingly very happy. Fans were stunned by the new kissing footage, because Healy confirmed back in March the couple was still together.</p><p>Only a week after the TikTok was released, a source claimed that the couple broke up due to "conflicting work schedules", however the pair has not commented on the issue.</p><h2 id=dua-lipa-is-recently-single><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Dua Lipa Is Recently Single</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FKA-Twigs-and-Matt-Healy.avif> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dua Lipa was in a relationship with 22-year-old model, Anwar Hadid for two and a half years. In December 2021, sources were reporting the couple was having issues due to conflicting work schedules, and the two traveling so much and having little time for each other. By January 2022 it was confirmed the two were "going their separate ways for now".</p><p>The video with Piper was one of the first sightings of Dua with a new boy since the breakup, six months prior, so fans were applauding and congratulating the singer for getting back out there.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Fans Believe Anwar Hadid's Mommy Issues Ended His Relationship With Dua Lipa</a></span></p><h2 id=the-friendship-between-dua-lipa-amp-fka-twigs><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Friendship Between Dua Lipa & FKA Twigs</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/dua-lipa-anwar-hadid84.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Did the girls know about Arón Piper getting steamy with each other? Now, the two singers have worked together in the past. Back in the fall of 2020 Lipa hosted a star-studded live stream concert called Studio 2054. The virtual event featured appearances from Elton John, Bad Bunny, Miley Cyrus, Kylie Minogue, Angèle, J Balvin, and Madonna. Lipa said that her and Twigs had known each other through mutual friends and were working on a collaboration together, which was teased during this live stream, but nothing ever came of it.</p><h2 id=their-new-single-why-don-39-t-you-love-me><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Their New Single Why Don't You Love Me</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/dua-lipa-fka-twigs-696x409.jpg><p>The single that never came to be, may finally be here? After the two performed together in 2020, fans were dying for this new single to be released but as time went by, it was revealed that when they performed the teaser, the whole track wasn't finished and wouldn't be for over a year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In January, when Twigs was promoting her new mixtape, she claimed in an interview with Zane Lowe that it was coming. The singer stated "honestly, there's actually no reason why Dua Lipa and I haven't finished 'Why Don't You Love Me.' I've been busy doing my mixtape, but maybe I'll give Dua a call. Maybe it's something that we need to — yeah, we'll do it. Yeah, we will. We'll do it."</p><p>While this interview was back in January, nothing was confirmed after this either, no timeline of a release or anything.</p><h2 id=is-it-all-a-publicity-stunt><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Is It All A Publicity Stunt?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/EovGE5kWMAAZk2i.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With this very "Don't Start Now" situation coming to light, fans are almost convinced this love triangle is all for publicity. Fans think that the single must be coming soon, and this triangle is to promote it, and possibly a music video with Arón Piper. So, is this a love triangle, or just a very clever way at teasing the finally completed collaboration between these talented pop stars? Maybe with a "The Boy Is Mine"-style music video starring Arón Piper?</p><p>Nothing is confirmed yet, nor has anyone commented on the love triangle situation.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>FKA Twigs Receives A Wave Of Support As She Speaks Out Against Shia LaBeouf</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiunqqVYrOsrYytrqKfo2Kxtq2MpaCpmV2Yrrazx61koqZdlnqtu9WeZK2qmZa7qLjEZp%2BeqpVirrOxjK2fnmWUmsGitcusZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
