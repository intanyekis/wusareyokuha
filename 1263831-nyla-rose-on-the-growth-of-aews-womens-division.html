Asked what the biggest gain from seeing more talent come in was for her as a performer, Nyla said that she not only gets to test herself, but it’s good to see a variety of talent coming in as well.</p><p>“Honestly, it’s kind of a little bit of all of that. Everybody is such a unique, strong personality. It’s such a beautiful thing to see that everyone is like this very unique ingredient for this delicious dish that we’re making. So getting to just play in the kitchen, if you will, and combine these different ingredients and see what you come up with — having different match styles, you know, someone like a Kris Statlander, a Riho, Hikaru Shida,” Nyla explained, “just the difference in variation from person to person is so vast. It’s an incredible thing to watch these matches come together.”</p><p>Nyla Rose is someone that comes across as being very confident in her abilities, whether it’s in the ring, on the mic, or on social media.&nbsp;Asked where her in-ring and outside personas meet, Nyla said there’s definitely an overlap between the two, but what fans see on TV is still close to reality.</p><p><span>“There’s definitely an overlap. There’s a Venn diagram somewhere out there where we see the overlap of the two. Obviously, regular Nyla has some other obligations to take care of, but when it’s game time, when it’s go time, we turn it up a notch, a few notches, if you will,” she stated. “We just try to push that envelope as far as we can and we just keep it moving.”</span></p><p>Watch our full interview with Nyla Rose at the top of this post, including her thoughts about being involved in the Tag Me In United campaign, her TBS Women’s Championship tournament match against Hikaru Shida, favorite AEW matches and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFvanFrYWK7urjAZqmoq5VivK9506GcZp%2BipMS1tIyonWaZlazAbsPOppynq12Ztre10qKmpw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
