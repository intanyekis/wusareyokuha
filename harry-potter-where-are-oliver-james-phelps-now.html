After that, though, what happened to them?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What Josh Herdman Has Been Up To Since 'Harry Potter'</a></span></p><p>Today, Oliver and James are in their 30s, and they're both married. James' wife is Annika, and they married in 2016. Oliver was the first to tie the know, with his beau Katy in 2015. But although they've clearly embraced their grown-up lives, they haven't quite let go of the wizarding world.</p><p>Well, let's be honest: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they've never really stopped being twin wizards</a>. Just like the two Weasleys, James and Oliver launched a sweets brand (it's called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wizards Magic</a>!) and are currently credited as Directors of the company.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The company sells a huge range of chocolates that sound like they could be straight out of a 'Harry Potter' film, which is apparently the overall point. The brothers&nbsp;also partner with all manner of brands for specialized HP merch, including LEGO.</p><p>Of course, the brothers are also very active over at Warner Bros., where the Harry Potter attraction continues to live on. The expansion at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter as well-attended, with the Phelps twins joining Matthew Lewis, Evanna Lynch, and Devon Murray for that event in 2014. After that, though, the brothers frequented the attraction and seem to love it just as much as fans do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the brothers continue to look a lot alike, they're probably easier to tell apart these days due to the fact that James has grown out his hair. He's also a bit of an athlete. In addition to golfing, he also runs, lifts weights, and bikes. He also documents all of it on Instagram.</p><p>Both brothers also run Cameo accounts where they record videos for fans, so they're clearly very engaged with their fan base. In short, the Phelps twins are the unsung heroes of the Harry Potter franchise both for sticking close to the universe that made them famous, while also growing up just enough that they're still good role models for the hordes of fans that follow them.</p><p>They've also shed light on some important issues with two separate podcasts (one in 2020 and a new one slated for 2021). As&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Muggle Net</a>&nbsp;reported, the brothers started with 'Double Trouble' and interviewed a ton of famous folks, including their castmates from HP.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But the next iteration of their talk show is called 'Normal Not Normal' and invites child stars to share their experiences and thoughts. Guests so far in 2021 have included stars like Mara Wilson (from 'Matilda'), Sasha Banks (WWE wrestler), and even Katie Leung (Cho Chang from HP).</p><p>Fans can't wait to see what else the Phelps twins are going to do next!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Daniel Radcliffe Thought About Rumors He Had COVID-19</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifmqqirnqxu9OtnKtlp52ys7GMmqmeZZ%2Bhtrex0WahmqWVqHqxtMSlp6xlnqTEcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
