He will be sorely missed by everyone. To the extent that you are able, please accept the sincere expressions of compassion that we offer. Dr. Wallace has devoted both his personal life and his professional career to the mission of removing the societal and structural obstacles that lead to poorer health outcomes for those who are a part of disadvantaged areas.</p><p>People who identify as being part of the LGBTQ+ community and people of color in general make up this group of people. Dr. Wallace has a significant amount of experience working in the field of public health. As a direct consequence of his work, we have great hopes that others will be motivated to replicate what he has accomplished and take up the mantle he has set for themselves.</p><p>As part of his acceptance speech when he was presented with the Beti Thompson Health Equity Staff Champion Award at the beginning of this year, Wallace stated the following as part of his remarks: “There are so many communities that are impacted by health inequalities and I hope you’ll all be continuing that work.” Because if it isn’t COVID-19, then it’s going to be something else, such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, or any of the other numerous systemic disorders that are afflicting these communities.</p><p>“Because if it isn’t COVID-19, then it’s going to be something else. On their behalf, I would want to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to you for the service you have provided. The amount of work that needs to be done is still rather substantial.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtp5Kewbat0bJlnKedZMC1sc%2BhmK6mXayurbjAnJxmp5Kewbat0bJknZ2RqbVustSnnKuZnGKur7CMr6CsoaSWwaq7zWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
