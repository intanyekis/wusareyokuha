As the guitarist for The Rolling Stones, Richards has not only achieved unparalleled success but has also become an enduring symbol of rock 'n' roll rebellion and resilience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Rolling Stones achieved unparalleled success, becoming one of the most influential and enduring rock bands in history. Their albums, including Beggars Banquet, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, and Exile on Main St., are considered classics of rock music. The band's numerous hit singles, such as "Satisfaction," "Paint It Black," and "Angie," continue to be beloved by fans worldwide.</p><p>In addition to his musical prowess, Keith Richards ventured into acting. One of his most notable roles was Captain Teague Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series, starring alongside Johnny Depp. Richards' portrayal of Jack Sparrow's father added a unique and entertaining dimension to the popular franchise.</p><p>Keith Richards' influence extends far beyond his music and acting career. He embodies the essence of rock 'n' roll, with his wild lifestyle and iconic fashion sense. His image, complete with unkempt hair, bandanas, and skull rings, has become synonymous with rock rebellion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, someone like Keith Richards has never been known for being shy with their opinions, no matter how controversial they are. Recently, Richards stole headlines when he remarked on rap music.</p><h2 id=keith-richards-recently-said-he-hated-rap-music-because-it-is-like-getting-yelled-at>Keith Richards Recently Said He Hated Rap Music Because It Is Like Getting Yelled At</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/keith-richards-now.jpg><p>Instead of giving the genre credit, and acknowledging the influence that it has had on pop culture, the guitarist opted to take some dated shots at it.</p><p>"I don’t really like to hear people yelling at me and telling me it’s music, aka rap. I can get enough of that without ­leaving my house," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the guitarist said</a>.</p><p>Not exactly shocking coming from a dated rocker like Richards, but plenty of legendary rockers have expressed love and appreciation for rap.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is not the only time that Richards has taken a shot at the genre. In 2015, he railed against rap.</p><p>"Rap -- so many words, so little said. What rap did that was impressive was to show there are so many tone-deaf people out there. All they need is a drum beat and somebody yelling over it and they're happy. There's an enormous market for people who can't tell one note from another," he said.</p><p>Again, this sounded dated even back in 2015, and eight years later, nothing has come along that has changed Richards' mind. With a wealth of incredible rap music to choose from, it's disappointing that Richards hasn't found something that he actually likes.</p><p>While rap has taken a shot from Richards, they are not the only genres that he has hit out at.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-rolling-stones.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Rolling Stones Aren't The Only Iconic Band To Have Their Songs Sued For Copyright Infringement</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The Rolling Stones may be the latest big-name musician to face a copyright infringement lawsuit, but they're certainly not alone...</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=keith-richards-has-taken-aim-at-rock-and-metal-as-well>Keith Richards Has Taken Aim At Rock And Metal As Well</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar51850069.jpg><p>On pop music, Richards said, "I don’t want to start complaining about pop music. It’s always been rubbish. I mean, that’s the point of it. They make it as cheap and as easy as possible and therefore it always sounds the same; there’s very little feel in it. I like to hear music by people playing instruments. That is, I don’t like to hear plastic synthesised muzak, as it used to be known, what you hear in ­elevators, which is now the par for the course."</p><p>In the previously 2015 rap interview, the guitarist also took aim at the then-current state of rock and metal.</p><p>"It sounds like a dull thud to me. For most bands, getting the syncopation is beyond them. It's endless thudding away, with no bounce, no lift, no syncopation," he said regarding rock.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His metal take was just as blunt.</p><p>"Millions are in love with Metallica and Black Sabbath. I just thought they were great jokes."</p><p>Ouch.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mick-jagger-and-keith-richards-vicious-feud-led-to-some-of-the-rolling-stones-best-songs.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Mick Jagger And Keith Richards Vicious Feud Led To Some Of The Rolling Stones' Best Songs</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Mick Jagger and Keith Richards' feud almost destroyed their band, but it also inspired memorable songs...</span><p>During his time in the limelight, Richards has done this many, many times.
