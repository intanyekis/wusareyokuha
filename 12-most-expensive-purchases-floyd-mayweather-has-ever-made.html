Imagine making more money in one day then you made in your entire last year combined. How would you spend it? What would you do?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>People tend to say that the more money you make, the more problems you’ll come across. But let’s face it. Sitting on nearly half a billion dollars in cash is a fantastic problem to have.&nbsp;<a href=#>Floyd Mayweather</a> is no stranger to hard work. You simply cannot reach the pinnacle of any sport without dedicating your entire life to being the best in the world. The countless hours Mayweather has committed to training and studying the sport of boxing since his childhood is the reason he is in the position he is today; the highest paid athlete on the planet.</p><p>Hate him or love him, the man stinks of success. Whether he deserves the insane paydays he receives for his fights will always remain up for debate. One thing we can all agree on though, is the man knows how to enjoy the fruits of his labour. Here are the 12 most expensive purchases Mayweather has ever made.</p><h2 id=300k-on-a-mercedes-party-bus>12. 300k on a Mercedes Party Bus</h2><p>via:bestchauffeured.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mayweather copped a fully decked out Mercedes Sprinter that set him back 300k. The bus comes equipped with massage chairs, full champagne bar and satellite TV with a surround sound stereo system.</p><p>Chances of you ever coming across one of these bad boys is virtually impossible. This ride was custom built for Mayweather and just screams tailored luxury.</p><p></p><h2 id=400k-on-hermes-bags>11. 400k on Hermes Bags</h2><p>via:pursuitist.com</p><p>Mayweather owns so much luxury clothing and accessories that tallying up the value of them all would be close to impossible. His shopping patterns tend to be erratic and he will splurge on items at any given time.</p><p>One example is the 400k he spent at Hermes in one day when shopping in paris. His pickups? 5 crocodile bags including four travel bags and andorange Birkin Bag.&nbsp;Mayweather posted his purchase on his Instagram account with the caption: “Over $400,000 spent in Hermes cause I stay in my lane”.</p><p>Enough Said.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=750-000-contract-buyout>10. $750,000 Contract Buyout</h2><p>Kind of strange when you think about it. But one of the biggest purchases Mayweather has ever made was in 2006, when he decided to exercise a provision in his contract that gave him the opportunity to become a free agent. He payed a cool 750k to Toprank Promotions to buy out the remainder of his contract and immediately formed his own company.</p><p>This bold move is what laid the foundation for him to become one of the highest paid athletes of all time. By controlling his own destiny, he made sure that no promoters would be able to stick their hands in his pockets and instead, kept all profits from his fights to himself.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-figure-sweet-sixteen-for-his-daughter>9. 7-Figure Sweet Sixteen for his Daughter</h2><p>We’ve all heard stories of celebrities spoiling their kids on their birthdays.

While being interviewed on <a href=#>Jimmy Fallon’s</a> talk show, Mayweather admitted to betting 1.1 million dollars on the Oregon Ducks back in 2013. He walked away a winner with a cool 1 million dollars.</p><p>Puzzled as to how Mayweather could gamble such a large amount of cash on a sporting event, Fallon told Mayweather: “I wouldn’t be able to watch that, I wouldn’t be able to do anything. I don’t know what I’d do. I would leave the country.”&nbsp;Mayweather shrugged off the conversation, stating ‘It was a cool game”, and acknowledged that he had no problem stomaching the huge bet he placed.</p><p>He clearly isn’t phased by much and has a ton of cash to risk.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-5-million-dollar-miami-penthouse>6. 1.5 Million Dollar Miami Penthouse</h2><p>via:www.celebdigs.com</p><p>Mayweather bought this property in the Saint Tropez condominiums of Sunny Aisles back in 2010.
